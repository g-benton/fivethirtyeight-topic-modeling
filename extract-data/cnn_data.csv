"(CNN) Parents in a remote Russian archipelago are scared to send their children to school after a ""mass invasion"" of polar bears into residential areas, state news agency TASS reported.

Novaya Zemlya, located off Russia's northeastern arctic coast, has been swarmed by dozens of polar bears since December. The region's largest settlement, Belushya Guba, with a population of about 2,500 people, has reported more than 50 sightings.

Local administrator Alexander Minayev said bears had attacked people and entered buildings. A state of emergency was announced on Saturday, with up to 10 polar bears reportedly on the settlement's territory at any given time.

""People are scared. They are frightened to leave homes, and their daily routines are broken,"" Minayev said. ""Parents are afraid to let the children go to school or kindergarten.""

Disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak was due to appear in the dock Tuesday on multiple corruption charges related to the 1MDB financial scandal, but the country's Court of Appeal issued a last-minute stay Monday afternoon, his lawyer Shafee Abdullah told CNN.

Najib's defense team has filed multiple appeals over procedural issues in the run-up to the trial, and judges ruled that it should be delayed until one of them can be heard.

Tuesday's trial was on just a handful of the many charges facing Najib over the billions of dollars allegedly embezzled from the 1MDB fund . Other trials are scheduled for later this year, and the entire legal process could last months, if not years.

The delay will be seen as something of a victory for Najib, who has consistently maintained his innocence. Since the prosecution began, he has attempted to paint it as a political vendetta against him, led by his former mentor Mahathir Mohamad, who turfed him out of office in a shock election victory in 2018.

A date has not been set for the trial to resume and Najib's lawyer told CNN the appeal process could take weeks.

New Najib?

Speaking ahead of the Court of Appeals ruling, Tony Pua, a finance ministry official and longtime critic of Najib, told CNN the complexity of the scandal and the multiple cases against the former PM could work in his favor.

""He has done a fantastic job in keeping his hopes alive for a comeback,"" Pua said. ""His strategy is very obvious, it will take a while to jail him, so he probably hopes that before he gets jailed there could be a change of government.""

While Pua is confident of the current government's ability to repeat its last year's success in future elections, Najib has been in near constant campaign mode since he made bail on the corruption charges.

That has involved a reinvention of sorts and Najib -- a scion of the Malaysian elite, whose wife Rosmah Mansor allegedly owned a multimillion-dollar pink diamond necklace, among other luxury goods -- has portrayed himself as a man of the people.

In a video posted online which quickly went viral in Malaysia, Najib sang a Malay-language version of the 1970s song ""Kiss and Say Goodbye,"" with the lyrics changed to criticize Mahathir's governing coalition.

""This is the saddest day in my life,"" Najib says during the intro. ""On May 9, 2018, I was ousted. All this while I fought relentlessly for the people whom I loved and are dear to me. But what can I do?""

He then accuses the opposition of ""slander and revenge,"" before the chorus lays into the government for leaving people's hopes ""shattered into dust.""

The video was originally uploaded to Najib's Facebook page , where he has taken to posting regular criticisms and snarky comments about coalition politicians and government policies, as well as photos poking fun at himself

But the charm campaign isn't just online, and Najib has also toured the Malaysian island of Langkawi , meeting with locals and posing for selfies.

Pua laughed when asked about Najib's new social media presence.

""It's kind of surreal to see someone who brought down his party, who has been indicted in pretty much all media around the world, indicted in the US, indicted in Malaysia, to be out and about and to be able to make himself look like ... an antihero or even hero among some segments of the population,"" Pua said.

Malaysian police display photos of luxury goods seized from Najib's home in Kuala Lumpur.

Delay benefits defense

Analysts were also skeptical about Najib's new image. James Chin, director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania, said ""support on social media does not translate into real political support.""

""Once people hear how much money was involved and how (Rosmah) misused the money, support will disappear,"" he said.

Chin said that while he expected Najib would be found guilty on at least one of the charges, ""he will not be going to jail anytime soon,"" and he would appeal every step of the way.

""The earliest the entire process will finish will be sometime in 2020 or 2021,"" Chin added. ""The whole point is to remove Najib from Parliament, if he is found guilty he will lose his seat before the next general election,"" which is due to take place before September 2023.

Ross Tapsell, director of the Malaysia Institute at the Australian National University, said that ""the longer the trial takes and the longer Najib is able to parade around freely, the harder it is for the government to justify to the masses that the level of corruption was as high and as widespread as they said it was during the election campaign.""

""Najib's PR social media-driven strategy highlights how free he continues to be (even if he can't leave the country), suggesting the charges were overstated, but that is not going to win over everyone,"" Tapsell added. ""People still remember the luxury handbags and bags of cash seized from their apartment immediately after the election.""","Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) Acting US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan landed in Afghanistan for an unannounced visit Monday amid increasing uncertainty about the future of the longest-running US war in history.

Shanahan met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, the country's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, and defense minister Asadullah Khalid during the first few hours of his trip.

Shanahan's trip comes after US President Donald Trump publicly questioned the benefits of a continued military presence in Afghanistan in multiple interviews.

A defense official told CNN in December that Trump decided to withdraw about half of the 14,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan at the same time he ordered the military to pull out of Syria.

Patrick Shanahan (L) is greeted in Afghanistan by Gen. Austin Scott Miller.

Shanahan said from his plane that he had no orders to ""step down our forces in Afghanistan,"" but was tasked with supporting ongoing peace talks between Washington and the Taliban.

Thailand's Electoral Commission announced on Monday that the ""monarchy must remain above politics.""

In a shock announcement on Friday, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, 67, said she would stand as the prime ministerial candidate for the Thai Raksa Chart Party (Thai Save The Nation, or TSN) aligned with populist former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by the military in a 2006 coup.

The candidacy of a close member of the royal family is unprecedented in Thailand since the era of absolute monarchy ended 86 years ago.

Thai law stipulates that once a name is submitted, it cannot be withdrawn -- though the Electoral Commission has the power to decide the legitimacy of candidates.

The March 24 election is widely considered to be a vote between a form of democracy and legitimized authoritarian rule, following a military coup in 2014.

Coup leader turned Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha announced his own candidacy Friday. The commission revealed on Monday that Prayut was among 45 candidates it said was eligible to contest the vote

Ubolratana gave up her royal status when she married American Peter Jensen in 1972, but returned to Thailand in 2001 following her divorce and continued to be active in royal life.

In a televised statement on Friday, hours after TSM announced Ubolratana would run for prime minister, Vajiralongkorn said: ""To involve a high-level member of the royal family in politics, directly or indirectly, is against royal traditions, norms and the national culture,"" adding that ""it is deemed extremely inappropriate.""

Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn outside Bangkok's royal palace on May 14, 2018.

TSN on Friday said it accepted Vajiralongkorn's words ""with our loyalty to the King and all royal family members"" and would comply with the ""Electoral Commission's regulations, election laws, constitution and to royal traditions with respect.""

It stands ""ready to bring prosperity to Thailand with respecting the decision of the people under democratic system with the King as our head of state.""

Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932 and the royal family is highly revered in the country. Criticizing or insulting the monarchy -- which officially applies to the King, the regent, or heir apparent, is punishable with prison sentences of up to 15 years under the nation's strict lese majese law

Vajiralongkorn's statement deemed the princess part of the royal family despite her having relinquished her royal title and instructed that royal family members are constitutionally above politics.

Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya attends the Golden Kinnaree Awards on September 30, 2009 in Bangkok, Thailand.

""It suggested she has royal status without royal title because she has been performing functions and duties on behalf of the King,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. ""The scope of this royal command was aimed to address and prohibit senior royalty in politics.""

The princess on Friday thanked ""all Thais for the love and moral support given to me in the past day.""

""I want to say again with sincerity that I want to see Thailand move forward,"" she said. ""I want to see all Thais have rights and the chance to live well and be happy.""

TSN is an offshoot of Pheu Thai, the latest incarnation of Thaksin's party that has won every election since 2001.","Hong Kong (CNN) A bonsai thief has stolen seven tiny trees worth at least 13 million yen ($118,000) from a garden space in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo.

The loot included a rare 400-year-old shimpaku tree, a star of the bonsai world, which was due to be entered in a Japanese beauty competition this month.

The prize shimpaku alone was worth over 10 million yen ($90,000), according to Fuyumi Iimura, wife of the bonsai master who crafted the trees.

""We treated these miniature trees like our children,"" she said. ""There are no words to describe how we feel. It's like having your limbs lopped off.""

Iimura added that those responsible for the thefts, committed over a series of nights last month, were likely professionals, as they had identified the ""most valuable trees"" from the couple's roughly 5,000 hectare park, which has around 3,000 bonsai trees.

Several of our 19 places to visit in 2019 are bouncing back after natural disasters that hit their economies hard. You can do some good while enjoying the beach in Hawaii, Kerala or St. Barts.

Or you can mark the 50th anniversary of man's first walk on the moon, the 100th anniversary of Grand Canyon National Park, Liechtenstein's tricentennial and importantly, Ghana's Year of Return marks 400 years since enslaved Africans arrived in North America.

Whether you want to relax, explore or learn -- or all three -- there's a destination on this list for you. Here they are in alphabetical order:

Christchurch, New Zealand

l e v a r t

Many people only associate with Christchurch with its most tragic event -- the 2011 earthquake that leveled much of the city and resulted in 185 deaths. But it isn't the natural disaster that defines a city -- it's the way they choose to regroup and rebuild.

Several years later, Christchurch has been reconstructed to be respectful of locals and to be more thoughtful of the environment, creating a city that feels at once hopeful and dynamic. Vendors who once sold out of a pop-up mall of containers are now moving to brick-and-mortar locations, followed by loyal locals. Colorful street art about hope and resilience has appeared all over the city. Music performances are often held in rotating venues around the city instead of a single opera house or concert hall so more people have a chance to attend.

The elegant Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial pays homage to those who were lost, while the Transitional Cathedral -- intended to be, by its name, temporary refuge made of cardboard for locals to go following the quake -- has become a permanent part of the cityscape.

Egypt

The land of the Pharaohs has been welcoming tourists for so long, it's a wonder that archeologists haven't discovered hieroglyphics depicting backpackers.

Sadly, the country's tourist trade has taken a battering in recent times with security concerns and political upheaval keeping many visitors away. A December 28, 2018 attack that killed four people near the Pyramids of Giza shows that there are still serious security issues.

While that may deter some, others will continue returning to a country that appears to be taking faltering steps back on to the mainstream tourism circuit.

So what's different in 2019? Well, while the sand has been settling on deserted classic monuments, Egyptologists have been brushing it gently aside elsewhere to discover a litany of exciting finds, many of which are now being opened to the public

Mummies, sphinxes, tombs and fresh pyramid mysteries have all been unearthed over the past year, as Egypt proves time and again it has many more secrets yet to be revealed.

And while safety concerns persist, hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Pyramids of Giza, the Great Sphinx, the Valley of the Kings take place without incident each year. Likewise, Egypt's main Red Sea resorts are considered safe.

Expect a major tourism drive by Egypt in coming months as it gears up to 2020's expected opening of its highly anticipated Grand Egyptian Museum . Until then, there's a perfect opportunity to beat the crowds.

Fukuoka, Japan

Fascinating history. Incredible eats. Natural beauty. If the Japanese seaside city of Fukuoka isn't already on your radar, it's time to recalibrate your Japan travel plans.

Capital of the prefecture of the same name and one of several host cities for the 2019 Rugby World Cup , Fukuoka is the gateway to the island of Kyushu.

It's the perfect destination for those looking to go beyond the well-trodden destinations like Osaka, Tokyo and Kyoto and see a new corner of Japan.

Highlights of this city and its surrounding area include the ruins of the 17th-century Fukuoka Castle, the beautiful Kyushu National Museum and Dazaifu Tenmangu , a Shinto shrine that's home to over 6,000 plum trees that blossom in stunning fashion each spring.

And while we're on the subject of blooms, another famed destination is the tunnel of wisterias at Kawachi Fuji-en Garden in Kitakyushu, about an hour's drive from the city. Another worthy day trip is Yanagawa, an hour outside of the Fukuoka, famed for its picturesque canals.

But we've saved the best for last: The food.

Due to its seaside position on Japan's east coast, Fukuoka is a seafood lover's dream destination and considered one of Japan's top foodie cities. Just head for the Nagahama Fish Market . The commercial market floor only opens to the public once a month but you can still visit its restaurants, which are open seven days a week.

We do recommend saving space for a bowl of Hakata ramen though. A local specialty, it's the original tonkotsu ramen and prized for its deliciously fatty pork broth. Try it at Ichiran , a restaurant chain found throughout Japan that originated in Hakata, Fukuoka.

Ghana

West Africa's poster nation for economic success and political stability is hoping to trade up its tourism status for 2019, with a campaign targeting the African diaspora whose ancestors were victims of the brutal slave trade of centuries gone by.

The country's Year of Return marks 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in North America. It's a somber recognition of the evil that befell Ghana's past inhabitants and their descendants — and the strength with which they've faced it.

Legacies of the slave trade are unavoidable. Cape Coast Castle, one of many historic coastal forts, was where slaves were held before being dispatched to America and the Caribbean. This brutal and fascinating reminder was visited by the Obamas in 2009 and Melania Trump in 2018.

For all the sobriety of this anniversary, what also awaits visitors to Ghana is the warm, intoxicating embrace of country completely at ease with its identity rushing headlong toward a bright future.

The capital, Accra, crackles with the dynamism of a city on the upswing, with a nightlife scene to match. For those wanting to escape its relentless excitement, Ghana's 335-mile coastline boasts empty surfing spots like Cape Three Points, while its many protected wildlife zones, including Mole National Park, are home to wild elephants, Nolan warthogs and spotted hyenas.

Grand Canyon, United States

One of the world's most magnificent natural wonders and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Grand Canyon National Park is marking its centennial anniversary in 2019.

Never mind that the canyon is actually about five or six million years old, give or take a few years, with rocks at the canyon bottom dating back some 2,000 million years.

There are human artifacts dating back nearly 12,000 years to the Paleo-Indian period, and the area has been continuously occupied up to the present day.

It was first protected by the US government in 1893, and it became Grand Canyon National Park on February 26, 1919, offering the 1.2 million-acre park the most US government protection possible.

About 277 miles long and a mile deep from rim to river at various points, the park attracted more than 6 million visitors for the first time ever in 2017.

Yet most people view the Grand Canyon by the magnificent South Rim, while some visit the North Rim in season (it closes for the winter).

More adventurous sorts can take two days to hike to the canyon bottom. (Riding a mule is an easier option.) Hikers who trek from rim to rim could take three days one-way, while rafters might take two weeks or more.

Hawaii Island, United States

After a few shaky months, Hawaii Island is back, warmly welcoming visitors to its slice of paradise.

Following the devastating volcanic eruption of Kilauea in May 2018 that impacted air quality, destroyed homes and put a damper on tourism, the island of Hawaii (locals ask that you not call it ""the Big Island"") is once again primed to show off its magnificent beauty, astonishingly diverse landscape and relaxed island pace.

Although two-thirds of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed during the Kilauea eruption, much of it reopened in late September, and trails and attractions continue to attract visitors.

Volcano House , located in the park, reopened in early November and boasts top-notch star-gazing along with unparalleled volcano views.

While there are still some closures on the island and within the park, the number of new offerings is impressive enough to please even the most ambitious travelers.

Opening soon is Binchotan Bar & Grill at Fairmont Orchid -- think locally sourced seafood and local produce grilled over binchotan or white charcoal.

For locally-inspired brews, head to Ola Brew Co . Go for the Kona Gold Pineapple Cider or the Watermelon Double IPA, and stay to soak up the community vibe.

Resort aficionados, who long for breathtaking sunsets over the water, may wish to stay at the recently renovated Mauna Lani Auberge Resorts Collection, while boutique hotel seekers looking for something a little more rustic and down-to-earth can't go wrong at the Kamuela Inn , located in Waimea, an area of the island known for its ranching history.

The Hebrides, Scotland, UK

You might have heard stories about Scotland's fine white sand dunes, turquoise waters, rugged mountains, crumbling castles -- but nothing can prepare you for seeing the Hebridean islands

The most famous of the lot, the Isle of Skye, makes it onto many travelers' must-see lists, but the lesser-visited Lewis and Harris, the most northerly Outer Hebridean Island, also deserves to be there.

The birthplace of Harris Tweed, the famous cloth that's been woven, dyed and spun by the islanders for centuries, is also home to its own Stonehenge-style mystery in the Callanish Standing Stones.

Unlike Stonehenge, visitors can get up close to the standing circle of boulders at Callanish, which is believed to have been erected about 5,000 years ago.

For this and Lewis and Harris' other wonders, it's worth the drive to Ullapool, close to the northern tip of the Scottish mainland, and the 2.5-hour ferry across a choppy stretch of the Atlantic to explore these islands. Alternatively, there's the plane from Glasgow straight to Stornoway, the island's capital.

Each Hebridean island has its own distinctive vibe, but they're all grounded in a similar small-town community spirit. Islay, the southernmost Hebridean isle, known for its whisky distilleries and incredible beaches, offers a true sense of island life. Driving around, visitors might be more likely to encounter cows than people, but any meeting with an islander will likely earn an ""Islay wave"" -- a friendly acknowledgment from a fellow driver.

Jaffa, Israel

Tel Aviv-Yafo is often lumped together as one unit for the convenience of an airport and Google Maps, but 4,000-year-old Yafo (often spelled Jaffa in English) is as different from Tel Aviv as Brooklyn is from Manhattan.

The artsier sister, Jaffa has traditionally been home to narrow streets packed with jewelers, sculptors, antique dealers, candlemakers, painters and more displaying and selling their work. Also making the case for Jaffa as much more than a day trip are the three boutique hotels that opened in 2018 -- The Jaffa The Setai and The Drisco.

How to spend a perfect day there? Have hummus and pita at the jam-packed communal tables at Abu Hassan followed by sweets at Abulafia bakery. Experience the world's first deaf-blind theater company, Nalaga'at (there's a cafe next door where all the baristas are deaf and you can learn Israeli Sign Language signs for words like ""coffee""), and don't forget to pick up banana-scented soaps and orange-blossom perfume from Zielinski & Rosen.

This area of India has it all: sun, sea, sand, good food, houseboats, culture and wildlife. Its spectacular natural landscapes -- think palm trees and sprawling backwaters -- lend the region the nickname ""God's Own Country.""

Severe floods during the summer of 2018 wreaked havoc across this southwestern state, but many of its top tourist destinations escaped unscathed.

Visitors will likely land at Kochi International, an airport powered entirely by solar panels. The ancient port city of Kochi, once occupied by the Portuguese, is a multicultural hub offering plenty to do and see. It's a great place to check out traditional Kathakali dance, the storytelling dance form known for its colorful and intricate costumes and masks that hails from Kerala.

Kerala is also great for beaches, particularly in the southern part of the state. Postcard-perfect Kovalam is a surfing hotspot, while Varkala is good for just relaxing.

Kerala's backwaters are famous for a reason: a nexus of waterways linking the regions' villages and best explored via kettuvallam -- a traditional wooden houseboat. It's worth spending anywhere from a single afternoon to a week on one of the many rental houseboats on offer, enjoying the sights and sounds drifting by.

Other top trips include Munnar to see the tea plantations, and Periyar National Park, a wildlife haven offering guided jungle treks.

Liechtenstein

The world's sixth smallest country packs a lot within its borders.

Tucked between Austria and Switzerland, the tiny principality of Liechtenstein covers just 160 square kilometers (62 square miles).

Yet castles, museums and spectacular hiking and biking trails are all draws in this sliver of alpine terrain that's also a banking powerhouse for uber-wealthy international clients.

Liechtenstein has gone unnoticed by most of the world's tourists during the principality's 300 years, but the 2019 tricentennial puts the country -- with its 37,000 residents -- in the spotlight.

Ceremonies, exhibitions and celebrations are planned throughout the year to mark Liechtenstein's 300th anniversary as a principality.

In May, the Liechtenstein Trail i s set to debut. The 75-kilometer (47-mile) trail stiches together a network of existing paths that traverse all 11 municipalities. A new app -- complete with Augmented Reality -- will help visitors navigate the route.

Hikers looking for a thrill beyond the postcard-perfect landscapes can join a falconer and a golden eagle on a soaring 90-minute hiking adventure near Malbun.

Liechtenstein's capital, Vaduz, is home to a handful of museums featuring fine art, cultural artifacts, postage stamps and more. The principality's Treasure Chamber features valuable items belonging to the Princes of Liechtenstein.

Don't miss: The country's most precious treasure may be its show-stopping alpine setting, complete with strategically perched fairytale stone castles like the Gutenberg Castle in Balzers.

Athletes and racing adventurers will be working up an appetite in Peru in 2019.

The Pan American and Parapan American Games will be hosted in Lima (July 26-August 11), where nearly 7,000 competitors will vie for dominance in 39 sports. Well before those athletes arrive, 2019 will start full-throttle with the 2019 Dakar Rally on January 6-17.

Starting and finishing in Lima, the Dakar Rally is an 11-day odyssey that involves more than 300 participating vehicles -- from motorcycles to trucks -- racing along a 5,000-kilometer route in Peru.

All that exertion deserves a delicious reward, and Lima is ready to feed you.

Like all the world's great cities, New York ebbs and flows in a constant state of change and progress, but it's always a destination worth visiting. So why now?

In June 2019, New York will host World Pride , the world's biggest LGBTQ celebration, and simultaneously honor its own history with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.

The riots took place at an iconic Greenwich Village gay bar -- now part of a federally recognized National Monument where queer and trans individuals in the community pushed back against a police raid.

The event marked a major moment for the advancement and recognition of LGBTQ rights in the United States, and its half-century mark is a reminder that New York will always be a home to those in need -- as long as you don't try to push your way onto the subway before everyone else has gotten off.

Beyond the special celebrations, there's a reason New York's classics are classics, from the Jackson Pollocks on display at the Met to a plate full of seafood at the 42nd Street Oyster Bar inside the architectural wonder that is Grand Central Terminal.

Normandy, France

Idyllic Normandy on France's northern coast has a big historical footprint for a long time. It's the place from which a conqueror named William set sail to tame England nearly 1,000 years ago.

But in 2019, our focus will be on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, 1944, the course of world history was altered because of the World War II English Channel crossing that launched the Allies' bloody liberation of France from Nazi rule.

There are more than 20 cemeteries in Normandy honoring war dead from Allied and Axis countries. The American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer , on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, is seen in the opening and closing scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and is a moving experience.

The Utah Landing Beach Museum , where you can see an original B-26 bomber, is one of several you can visit to learn more about the perilous effort. The Musée du Débarquement in the lovely village of Arromanches-les-Bains is another choice.

Bayeux is an excellent staging place for a vistor's tour of Normandy. While it's most known for the Bayeux Tapestry depicting the 1066 Norman invasion, it's also another excellent stop on your D-Day tour.

Oaxaca, Mexico

Oaxaca, in central Mexico, may not have gotten as much attention as Mexico City or Tulum, but it doesn't need to try hard to impress visitors, whether through its cuisine, art, ruins or mezcal.

This Mexican city, with its colorful colonial buildings and open-air marketplaces selling a seemingly infinite number of ingredients to make mole, the city's claim to fame, is a sight to behold.

And speaking of mole, a sauce made from chocolate and ground chiles and ladled generously over many Mexican specialties: Oaxaca is a food destination in its own right.

Plovdiv, Bulgaria

Wander the streets of Bulgaria's second largest city, from its Roman amphitheater to its colorful buildings.

Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, is getting ready to cement its status on the European city break circuit as one of two European capitals of culture for 2019. (The other is the rocky city of Matera , Italy.)

Known for its Roman ruins, Plovdiv was also the onetime stomping ground of Greeks and Ottomans. Its east-meet-west location means there's a mix of cultural influences, on show at places like the approx 600-year-old Dzhumaya Mosque and the Ottoman-era Chifte Banya -- a 16th century bathhouse that now houses modern art exhibits.

In the summer months, Plovdiv's cobbled streets transform into a bustling festival hub. In June and July, the Opera Open festiva l is in full swing and visitors can catch performances at the city's incredible Roman amphitheater. In the hipster Kapana district, which translates as ""the Trap,"" Kapana Fest offers cultural entertainment in the summer and fall. Wandering Kapana, you'll spot nightclubs neighboring craft shops and plenty of places to soak up the bohemian, laid-back vibe.

Weimar, Germany

An exhilarating, precarious tightrope walk between two World Wars, the years of the Weimar Republic -- 1918 to 1933 -- were a time of enormous artistic energy and bold freedom of expression in Germany

In what is surely one of the exciting periods in the country's history, Weimar -- a small city of 65,000 in Thuringia -- was not only the birthplace of the new republic but also the seat of a modernist revolution in art and design, with repercussions that would be felt around the world.

The Bauhaus art school -- now Bauhaus University -- was founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius and gave us artists such as Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.

Centenary celebrations will take place nationwide this year, with the ""100 Years of Bauhaus"" opening festival taking place in Berlin from January 16 to 24, but to see where it all began, head to Weimar's Bauhaus-Museum, then hit the streets to soak up the atmosphere.

For this little town is a cultural heavyweight -- in the late 18th and 19th centuries, it was the birthplace of German Classicism, giving us the writers Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller.

Composers Franst Liszt and Johann Sebastian Bach also made music here.

You'll be tripping over UNESCO World Heritage sites as you wander through the town, from the Goethe House to Belvedere Castle.","(CNN Business) If everything goes according to plan, truck driver Gordon Terry needs 44 hours to haul a shipment of car parts from Turin, Italy to Jaguar Land Rover's factory outside of Liverpool.

""By law, 10 hours is the most you can drive in one day,"" Terry said as he pointed to the tachograph which records his time on the road. The driver for Alcaline International Haulage Company gets as far as he can — usually about 500 miles — before stopping for the night.

Terry has been driving the heavily trafficked route from Italy's industrial heartland to auto factories in the north of England for 25 years. Many of the parts he carries are bolted onto vehicles within hours of their delivery in Britain, making him an essential part of the just-in-time manufacturing process used by companies like, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).

""[The] worst case scenario would be just blockades, vehicles parked up because we don't know what's going on,"" said David Zaccheo, operations director at Alcaline. ""It's difficult for me to obviously comment on that because we're not sure ourselves what's gonna happen.""

The problem at Dover

The biggest crunch point for drivers like Terry is expected to be the English Channel crossing between Dover and the French town of Calais. The port of Dover handled 2.5 million trucks in 2018 and another 1.7 million passed through the nearby Eurotunnel under the channel.

Britain's EU membership means trucks currently zip cross the border. But customs checks will be needed if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an exit agreement in place.

""Even adding a couple of minutes for the basic checks to see if the paperwork has been filed correctly will [cause trucks to] tail back up to about 20 kilometers [12 miles] on either side of the border,"" said Alex Veitch, head of global policy for the UK Freight Transport Association.

Gordon Terry has been driving trucks between Italy and Britain for 25 years.

Some of the largest manufacturing companies operating in Britain have warned of dire consequences if there are delays at the border.

""If one part is not at the right time, on the right position, next to the assembly line, we are facing a challenge,"" JLR CEO Ralf Speth told Sky News last year. ""That is a huge risk.""

BMW has already decided to shut its Mini factory in Oxford for a month of maintenance immediately after Brexit because it can't be sure that parts will be delivered.

""As a responsible business, we are looking at our options and taking steps to make sure we're prepared for a worst case scenario,"" BMW told CNN Business. ""This includes any potential port delays.""

The consequences could stretch far into the future. Aerospace giant Airbus said last month that it could redirect future investment away from its factories in Britain if trade links and supply chains are not protected.

""I'm not surprised that [companies] are probably looking at relocating to areas where that delay does not exist,"" said Veitch.

A computer screen shows Gordon Terry's route from Italy to Britain.

By land, sea or air

Across the channel, Port of Calais CEO Jean-Marc Puissesseau and his team have spent $6.8 million to build a holding area where 250 trucks can be parked for customs checks.

He downplayed talk of potential delays. Trucks that arrive at the border with the correct paperwork will be waived through customs, he said, while those with incomplete or inaccurate documents will be directed to the holding area.

""There is no reason to have a traffic jam, to have a big congestion of traffic,"" said Puissesseau.

Transport companies and trade experts think the French executive is too optimistic. They say that businesses are not prepared for a new customs regime, mainly because they haven't been told how the system will function.

Veitch said the port doesn't have the technology needed to check drivers' paperwork in real time. And the holding area for 250 trucks won't be nearly big enough, according to Alcaline's Zaccheo.

Zaccheo, whose trucks make 10,000 border crossings a year, is preparing for the worst. He recently purchased a helicopter to help circumvent border delays and rush small parts to UK factories.

""If the vehicles were to be stopped in Calais or Dover for customs checks and all of a sudden the lines stopped, then obviously time is of the essence,"" Zaccheo said. ""The helicopter can set off, recover those parts and fly straight to the plant.""

Alcaline has bought a helicopter to airlift urgent goods if trucks get stuck at the border.

'It's a reality'

Britain is set to leave the European Union in less than 50 days, but there's still no clarity on its exit plan. Terry, the truck driver, isn't worried about a messy divorce.

""We will rebuild,"" he said. ""It will create more industry. It will create more work for youngsters.""

Puissesseau is confident that Terry's trips across the channel won't be disrupted no matter what happens with Brexit. Still, he said the wounds caused by the separation run deep.

""It's a pity, really a pity, to know that just in front of us, 36 kilometers [22 miles], it will be a third country,"" Puissesseau said, pointing across the channel to the white cliffs of Dover.

Read More","New York (CNN Business) Burger King wants to move into the future, but it's still stuck in the past.

The fast food chain's parent company, Restaurant Brands International ( QSR ), said last month that it plans to modernize Burger King's locations across the country in a plan it calls ""Burger King of Tomorrow.""

Despite the project's name, Burger King's efforts are nothing new. The updated restaurants will feature self-order kiosks and sleeker restaurants — changes Burger King's competitors started making years ago. While its competitors were upgrading their stores, Burger King focused on marketing campaigns and menu items.

Burger King's new restaurants will feature open kitchens, double drive-thru lanes and outdoor digital menu boards. The burger chain hopes the changes will convince American consumers to order Burger King meals more often and spend more money at the store.

The plan is a move in the right direction, said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. It's important for Burger King to focus on increasing convenience. But the brand is ""playing catch-up here,"" he said.

Gimmicks and ads

Until its modernization plan, Burger King had been pushing gimmicky products, including a Halloween burger that gives you nightmares. It also weighed in on political topics with stunts like a ""chick tax"" on chicken fries in pink packaging, designed to call attention to the so-called pink tax on women's products, and a Whopper ""fast lane"" that sought to explain net neutrality.

""They've really focused a lot on marketing, product development and menu innovation,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail..

""They're very good at coming up with the one-off menu innovations,"" he added. ""That drives traffic.""

An exterior shot of a Burger King of Tomorrow restaurant.

But it hasn't been enough. In the first quarter of this year, Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International ( QSR ) reported that it was pleased with the burger chain's momentum. ""Our BK comparable sales results this quarter were driven by notable strength in the U.S.,"" Restaurant Brand's CEO Daniel Schwartz said at the time.

Since then momentum has slowed. In the second quarter the company said US comparable sales increased by 1.8%, and in the third quarter that figure slipped 0.7%. Same-store US sales rose by 2.4% in the third quarter at McDonald's. At Wendy's sales for that period also slipped, by 0.2%.

Those competitors put their upgrade plans in motion long ago.

Strong competition

Over the summer, McDonald's ( MCD ) announced a $6 billion investment toward modernizing most of its US restaurants by 2020. The McDonald's redesign also includes digital menu boards and self-order kiosks.

It's important for quick-service restaurants to update their stores to maximize convenience, Hottovy said. But it can take years for chains to get all of their franchises on the same page.

McDonald's is in a unique position, said Oches, because franchisers trust the company to deliver results.

""New store prototypes, remodels ... those things are expensive,"" Oches said. It's easier for a brand like McDonald's to convince franchises to spend that money. For others, it's more of a struggle.

Wendy's has spent the better part of a decade upgrading its stores to include lounge seating, digital menu boards and Wi-Fi. The company said this month that it's remodeled nearly half of its stores. Wendy's is also thinking about other improvements to stores: Last year the company announced a new series of smart design restaurants that use less energy than its traditional stores.

Burger King may have also struggled because unlike Wendy's ( WEN ) and McDonald's, it's part of a holding company.

Burger King and Tim Hortons merged in 2014 to form Restaurant Brands, which snapped up Popeye's last year.

""When you become this enormous multi-brand holding company ... [it's] hard to focus on details,"" said Sam Oches, editorial director of Food News Media at QSR magazine.

Catching up

To regain its footing, Burger King needs to increase traffic to stores and boost how much customers spend on regular orders.

""Regular trade is the bread and butter,"" said Saunders. ""The marketing and the seasonal occasions are much less important.""

Burger King is still in the early stages of the project, Schwartz noted in October, adding that there are already pilot restaurants operating in Miami.

""To refresh a store, that takes a long time,"" said Oches. ""So the fact that we're still at the very early stages of this tells me that they have a long road.""","New York (CNN Business) McDonald's is hoping a big new breakfast sandwich will help bring in more customers.

Read More","Across the room, one stood, statuesque, on the top of a small white table as another strutted playfully down a wooden walkway.

Photographers captured their moves, clicking quickly from different directions and vantage points. The photos were sultry, moody, and, occasionally, featured furry paws.

This wasn't an ordinary photo shoot. The subjects were cats with names like Passion, Shiloh, Buffy, and Blinx, who live at a café called KitTea , where visitors can pay to sip drinks and eat snacks while hanging out with resident and adoptable felines.

The photographers were engineers from consumer robotics company Anki , who captured these fuzzy critters on a trio of tiny Vector robots set up especially for this task.

A cat lounges near a Vector robot at KitTea.

The mission was to take as many pictures as possible to help Vector learn to detect the felines that live in people's homes.

Data — like, say, cute cat photos — is crucial to building artificial intelligence. The collection process is becoming increasingly important as we rely on AI to do an ever-increasing number of things, from helping self-driving cars navigate streets to getting virtual assistants like Alexa to respond to voices. That's because in order for AI to work well, it generally needs to be trained first on a lot of data — and not just any kind of data, but information that reflects the kinds of tasks the AI will be working on.

But it's not always easy to gather that data. One might even say the process can be like, well, herding cats.

The robot

Vector, which costs $250 and began shipping in October, is a cross between a companion and a pint-sized helper. It can give you a weather update, answer questions, take a picture of you, and play with the small, light-up cube that comes with it. It's the latest model of robot from Anki, which has sold 2 million robots thus far.

Vector looks like a tiny black bulldozer with an itty-bitty lift, and brightly colored, slightly askew eyes. The robot — its creators invariably refer to it as a ""he"" — chitters and chatters, whether or not anyone is playing with it, and sounds like a cross between WALL-E, a guinea pig and a fart.

Vector relies on data to figure out how to do all kinds of things. That includes using its front-facing camera to recognize people and avoid bumping into objects, or its microphones to listen to human commands that start with the words ""Hey Vector"" and then respond appropriately.

A shot of a cat taken by a Vector robot.

One thing Vector can't do right now is spot pets. Andrew Stein, Anki's lead computer vision engineer and a cat owner himself, sees this as a problem for a robot that's meant to engage with the world around it, which in many homes will include cats or dogs.

""If he's smart about his environment and responds to a cat differently than a coffee mug sitting on his table, then he knows what a cat is, and that feels different,"" Stein said as, nearby, a Vector photographed cats lounging on a rug.

Anki's engineers are using artificial intelligence to teach Vector how to do this. A key (and sometimes tricky) part of making this work involves collecting data — in this case, that data includes photos of cats sitting, swiping, scratching and sniffing.

The company, which is also working on dog detection, hopes to roll out a feature that lets Vector perceive cats and dogs early next year. At first, Stein said, Vector will simply be able to detect a cat or a dog in the home, and the company is considering a range of simple reactions it could have, like taking an image owners can view in an accompanying smartphone app, or somehow interacting with the pet.

Cool cats

But getting Vector to notice a cat roving around your living room is not as simple as just showing the robot thousands of pictures of cats from existing online databases. Anki engineers have already used tens of thousands of these pictures to train a neural network -- a kind of machine-learning algorithm loosely modeled after the way neurons function in the brain -- on basic cat detection.

But Stein said the images in these databases are quite different from what cats look like from Vector's viewpoint, which could be high above an animal or right in front of its paws, and most likely indoors.

A photo of a cat, taken by a Vector robot at KitTea.

""The key is getting data that is representative of what he will actually see when we deploy him into people's homes,"" he said.

Stein believes these images will ""tune"" Anki's neural network, which Vector can then use to better spot detect furry friends.

The approach makes a lot of sense to Jason Corso, an associate professor at the University of Michigan who studies computer vision and video understanding. If Anki only used existing data sets on the web, or YouTube videos or Flickr photos of cats, its data would have all the biases of how humans typically take photos of their cats, he said.

For instance, if Corso took a photo of his cat, a tuxedo named Harry Potter, it would be from Corso's height of about 5'6"". Chances are Vector won't typically be looking at cats from that high up.

""Indeed, the robot needs to understand what a cat is from its own perspective,"" he said.

To shoot the photos at KitTea, Anki employees placed Vectors on the floor, on tables and on a skinny wall-mounted catwalk. They pressed a button on Vector's back, which captured five images in succession. A tiny, front-facing display showed the cat what the robot was shooting.

Over several hours, the team gathered more than 1,500 photos of the cats at the cafe.

Anki wants Vector to recognize that an animal is nearby without necessarily seeing the animal's face, similar to how the robot can currently determine that a person is nearby by just seeing part of their body.

Eventually, Stein aims to have Vector identifying specific pets rather than just determining that a cat or dog is nearby. Then, perhaps, it could react differently to different animals -- which would make sense, since some animals may want to look at it while others may be more skittish or just disinterested.

This was true of the cats at the cafe. Some stared quizzically at the robot, while a few pawed, pounced on, or shoved it. Many of them didn't seem to notice the robot at all; they just wanted to snooze on shaggy round pillows or sit in a kitty-sized replica of the Golden Gate Bridge and stare wistfully out the window.","(CNN Business) If you travel for business, you've likely interacted with artificial intelligence (AI).

""We can be really sympathetic (to one another) -- how she came here at 17 and how I came here not speaking English. We know how much the other suffered,"" Moon says. ""In everyday life, you do experience certain things as an Asian girl living in Europe and in the same industry, so maybe that's our common thing, rather than our character or personality, because of our race.""

This experience of shared otherness is at the center of wryly titled ""Hanna Moon and Joyce Ng: English as a Second Language,"" their newly opened exhibition at London's historic Somerset House. A combination of site-specific projects and images from their individual archives that blend Eastern and Western aesthetics, it's the first exhibition the institution has dedicated to Asian photographers.

But don't expect another fashionable look at Asian femininity. Rather than focusing on their individual identities or making a statement about diaspora, the photographers chose to explore otherness more broadly and the feeling of being ""lost in translation,"" hinting at how mutable and universal these concepts can be.

""It's perfect timing to talk about 'things' like us,"" Moon jokes. ""Everyone's talking about diversity, but (the conversation) is quite limited and I feel like it's quite commercialized now,"" says Moon.

Agreeing, Ng adds: ""Diversity is so crucial right now, but then at the same time all the borders are tightening, so I think there's a tension.""

Last summer, both were commissioned by curator Shonagh Marshall to photograph a series looking at their feelings toward Britishness, set at Somerset House. Ng, inspired by the mass-media visuals that surrounded her in Hong Kong (""Advertising, window displays, all of that""), chose to shoot a fashion campaign-style series starring people she found passing through the museum's grounds, many of whom seemed as out of place as she felt in the neoclassical building.

""Before this, I don't think I stepped into Somerset House for a while, since my uni years, so I had no idea what kind of people pass through the building every day,"" said Ng. ""I was quite surprised that there's a whole spectrum of different people from different walks of life.""

Moon, meanwhile, chose to shoot Heejin, a long-term friend and muse from South Korea, with her newborn; and Moffy, a muse from west London. Set against luxe drapery erected in the museum's public spaces and shot after hours, the portraits recall traditional British portraits, but with a subversive twist. And when positioned next to photos that reveal the entirety of the scene -- including an indifferent security guard and professional lights -- the classical portrait set-up suddenly seems ridiculous.

""In the end, I thought it's not really about 'Oh, these Asian-heritage fashion photographers,'"" Moon stresses. ""It's more (about) being ourselves and trying to open up more conversation about being strangers.""

Five paintings, purportedly by Adolf Hitler, failed to sell on Saturday at a controversial auction in the German city of Nuremberg -- the location of several major Nazi rallies during the 1930s.

The watercolors, and a wicker chair emblazoned with a swastika symbol that was also believed to have been owned by the dictator, were among the items on sale at an auction criticized by several of the city's politicians and citizens.

But none of the works met their lofty starting prices, AFP reported, after suspicions about their authenticity were raised.

Among the paintings was a watercolor depicting a mountain lake, which had a starting price of $51,000. The collection comes from ""Austrian or European private ownership,"" from the estates of collectors, and from heirs, according to the auction house.

It remains illegal in Germany to hold public displays of Nazi symbols, except in certain educational or historical contexts. The auction house was consequently obliged to blur out Nazi insignia and symbols in their brochure to comply with German law.

And the sale sparked anger among politicians and the public, with Ulrich Maly, the mayor of Nuremberg, accusing it of being ""in bad taste"" in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.

The auction house was also forced to remove 26 artworks from its brochure over authenticity concerns. ""Unfortunately, we must inform you that some of the pictures have been dropped because of a review,"" the auction house said in a statement sent to German newspaper Spiegel.

This came shortly after prosecutors confiscated 63 artworks bearing ""A.Hitler"" or ""A.H."" signatures from the Weidler premises on Wednesday.

Antje Gabriels-Gorsolke, spokeswoman for the Nuremberg-Fuerth prosecution department, told Agence France-Presse that they had opened an investigation into certain individuals ""on suspicion falsifying documents and attempted fraud.""

""If they turn out to be fakes, we will then try to determine who knew what in the chain of ownership,"" she said.

Stephen Klingen and Christian Fuhrmeister from the Central Institute for Art History in Munich, south Germany, told CNN that people are ""rightly concerned"" with the auction. ""We are negotiating the past, in this case German past and Nazi memory, which is embodied in Adolf Hitler,"" they said.

""Something that has been taboo in the past, now pops up -- there are collectors who love to buy these objects.""

Klingen and Fuhrmeister said, however, that auctions such as this should go ahead despite widespread criticism. ""It is a necessary discussion -- to reevaluate the way Germany looks back at its Nazi past in the 21st century,"" they said.

""It is an ethical and moral question -- I believe any modern democracy should be able to cope with this.""

They added that they would rather see open discussion surrounding the history of Hitler and the Nazis, rather than it once again becoming taboo.

The Weidler auction house had described the event as a ""special sale"" in its brochure, and said the collection of works includes ""rare pictures and furnishings."" The auction house did not respond to a CNN request for comment.

Hitler was an aspiring ""would-be"" artist in his early years, but was rejected twice from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. He earned money by selling watercolors and ""post-card style"" pictures for newlywed couples before enlisting in the German army prior to the First World War.

Klingen described Hitler's artistic skills as ""a moderately ambitious amateur,"" but noted that his artworks were comparable to ""hundreds of thousands"" of others from the period.

The Weidler auction house has sold a number of alleged pictures by Hitler in recent years, the most expensive of which fetched $147,000 in 2014.","Alexandra Robbins is a journalist and author of multiple books, including ""Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities"" and the new book ""Fraternity: An Inside Look at a Year of College Boys Becoming Men.""

That's what a fraternity brother said to Oliver, (a pseudonym for) a sophomore I followed for a year for my new book, after Oliver learned a close friend had died and went to his room alone. In the wake of that loss, Oliver withdrew. But his fraternity brother was worried, and he took action.

Although Oliver was initially reluctant to open up, the discussion soothed him. And when the rest of his brothers heard the news, they immediately took over his house chores so he could have more space to work through his grief. It may surprise some to learn that it was because of his fraternity that Oliver learned to be comfortable confiding emotionally to friends in a way that he told me he would not have if his group were co-ed.

Most all-male institutions don't have reputations as sites of emotional growth. As the misleading term ""toxic masculinity"" dominates the news, colleges are sounding a clarion call to abolish all-male groups, fraternities often the most notorious among them. But during years spent reporting for a book on fraternities, I learned that eliminating all of them could deprive good people of important social resources that many schools otherwise do not provide. Women's, multicultural and LGBTQ centers admirably facilitate valuable opportunities for many students. However, college men -- whether racial minorities, LGBTQ, or straight and white -- need supportive, inclusive communities, too.

Does that sound controversial? It shouldn't.

(CNN) The red carpet for the premiere of ""Cold Pursuit"" was canceled this week after the film's lead actor, Liam Neeson, revealed during a press junket that he once considered carrying out a racist revenge attack because someone close to him said she had been raped by a black person.

The admission ignited a social media firestorm. Neeson was swiftly denounced by Twitter users as ""disgusting"" and an example of ""white, toxic masculinity.""

While Neeson later appeared on ""Good Morning America"" to clarify his comments and deny that he was a racist, the damage was already done. Neeson will now be known as an actor who contemplated a hate crime.

Many people mistakenly believe that there's no such thing as negative publicity. They couldn't be more wrong. Actors and other celebrities often speak out in public -- as Neeson was trying to do -- to promote their latest projects, and at times they venture into subjects that they're not particularly well suited to tackle. But, like everyone else, their bad behavior has severe consequences.

Of course, Neeson is not alone in his astonishing lack of public relations judgment. Here are a few other particularly memorable celebrity PR fails.

Roseanne Barr's racist tweets

JUST WATCHED Roseanne: 'Sorry that you thought I was racist' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Roseanne: 'Sorry that you thought I was racist' 01:44

These days, the increasingly ubiquitous use of Twitter by celebrities and other public figures has created plenty of opportunities for celebrities to get themselves in hot water -- not just for abnormal behavior, but also for inappropriate statements. The comedian Roseanne Barr learned this last year when ABC canceled her television show ""Roseanne"" just hours after she posted a tweet comparing former President Obama's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape.

Barr tried to respond with a time-honored failing PR strategy: Denying responsibility for her own behavior. Barr claimed the Ambien she had taken was to blame, causing the drug maker to memorably follow up with a tweet indicating that ""while all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.""

Coming on the heels of the #MeToo movement, Barr's firing was a powerful reminder that the media and entertainment industry has finally realized it cannot afford to be associated with celebrities who are responsible for egregious behavior like racism or sexual abuse -- no matter how big a following they command.

Tom Cruise's ""Couch Jump""

In 2005, Tom Cruise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote his newest film, ""War of the Worlds."" He deviated from the expected script, however, by professing his love for the actress Katie Holmes and, in a fit of excitement, jumping on Oprah's couch. The event resulted in what has been described as ""one of the first celebrity memes.""

Clips of the jump quickly spread across the internet. As the ""Today"" show noted 10 years later, the episode got so much attention that many people mistakenly remember him jumping more than once. It was an early lesson in how, in the age of digital technology, celebrities and other public figures must be especially careful about what they do in public, since memes are often shared and posted facetiously to illustrate points in other situations that are perceived to be similar.

But as Cruise began exhibiting more bizarre and inappropriate behavior -- such as publicly disagreeing with Brooke Shields about her postpartum depression and denouncing psychiatric medicine as part of his Scientologist beliefs -- the jump also came to be seen as a symbol of his perceived mental instability.

In 2010, Cruise explained the jump by saying, ""I wanted the audience to be happy, just like I wanted to make my sisters and my mother happy when I did those skits as a kid. But I'll take responsibility for my actions.""

Charlie Sheen's webcast rants

Since Cruise's infamous couch jump, such ill-advised public displays have increasingly become generated by celebrities through self-created content. Some of the most dramatic examples of this are Charlie Sheen's 2011 webcasts , in which he went on tirades against his former bosses on ""Two and a Half Men,"" repeating phrases, smoking cigarettes through his nose and looking deeply disturbed.

Of course, publicly attacking former bosses is generally not ever a good public relations strategy for a celebrity or anyone else, because it ensures that anyone thinks twice before working with the person in the future. But documenting incidents of anger and apparently unstable behavior on the internet -- rather than seeking to address one's issues privately and in healthier ways -- also guarantees that a person will forever be publicly defined by such episodes.

The FDA vowed to update its policies on dietary supplements, promising ""one of the most significant modernizations of dietary supplement regulation and oversight in more than 25 years,"" according to a statement by FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.

The FDA does not review dietary supplements before they hit the market, but it can intervene when products are deemed unsafe or carry false, misleading or unproven claims about their health benefits. The agency said these claims can cause real harm when people forgo approved treatments that have been proven safe and effective.

Roughly three-quarters of American consumers regularly take dietary supplements -- including four out of five older adults, Gottlieb said. The industry has swelled with 10s of thousands of products collectively worth more than $40 billion, he added.

On Monday, the FDA sent 12 warning letters and five online advisory letters to companies marketing their products illegally as Alzheimer's treatments. In recent months, the agency has also gone after a number of other products, including male enhancement supplements and those claiming to treat opioid addiction.

The Alzheimer's Association says there is a ""growing number"" of alternative treatments, including dietary supplements, that are ""promoted as memory enhancers or treatments to delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias."" The organization says there ""legitimate concerns"" when patients use these products instead of or alongside doctor-prescribed treatments -- citing unknown purity, questionable safety and efficacy, and possible drug interactions.

study published in October found that nearly 800 dietary supplements sold over the counter from 2007 through 2016 contained unapproved drug ingredients, based on an analysis of FDA data. More than one unapproved pharmaceutical ingredient was found in 20% of those supplements.

In his statement Monday, Gottlieb said plans were underway to enhance the agency's policies when it comes to dietary supplements -- including ""new enforcement strategies"" and ""a new rapid-response tool to alert the public"" of unsafe products. He said more details will be available ""in the coming months.""

""As the popularity of supplements has grown, so have the number of entities marketing potentially dangerous products or making unproven or misleading claims about the health benefits they may deliver,"" Gottlieb said.","(CNN) Nearly 100 children have died since the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo started last year -- and the crisis is gathering pace, with the number of new cases doubling last month, according to charity Save the Children.

A total of 97 children have died from the viral illness since the outbreak began in August, 65 of whom were younger than 5 years old, the group said.

And the number of new cases spiked in January, from around 20 a week to more than 40, according to the charity. In the last three weeks of January alone, there were 120 new cases overall.

Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected on average, though the latest outbreak has a fatality rate of around 60%.

The current outbreak in Congo is the second-deadliest and second-largest in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.

Most baby boomers approach retirement age unwilling to follow basic healthy lifestyle goals established by the American Heart Association, said Dr. Dana King, professor and chairman of the department of family medicine at West Virginia University, referencing his university's 2017 study comparing the healthy lifestyle rates of retired late-middle-aged adults with rates among those still working.

Kaiser Health News interviewed three other prominent experts on aging and health about how seniors can find the will to adopt healthier habits.

""People do financial planning for retirement, but what about retirement health planning?"" King said.

Motivated seniors can begin by following KHN's 10-step program:

1. Buy great sneakers. Purchase a pair of top-quality sneakers specifically designed for walking, said Carolyn Rosenblatt, founder of AgingParents.com , who started participating in triathlons at age 63 and continues to do them at age 70. Start by walking around the block. Expand that to 30-minute walks at least three times weekly -- or set a goal to increase your walking distance 10 percent each week. And leave your sneakers by the front door.

2. Practice your balance. The best way to avoid falls is to retain a good sense of balance, said Rosenblatt. Practice standing on one leg with your eyes closed for at least 30 seconds.

3. Improve your breakfast. Stop eating the sweet roll with coffee. Consider substituting a home-blended smoothie with a banana, seasonal fruits, almond milk and protein powder or a protein patty without sugar. And cut out excess sugar in all your meals, said Rosenblatt. Replace soda with seltzer water.

4. De-stress wisely. Find ways to manage your stress that don't involve food, alcohol or smoking. There are lots of meditation programs you can download on your phone and listen to for even 10 minutes, said Rosenblatt.

5. Practice resistance training. To keep your muscle mass from disappearing, do resistance training by lifting dumbbells or barbells or using weight machines, said Kay Van Norman, owner of Brilliant Aging, a consulting firm for healthier aging. ""Your muscles are amazing, but if you don't use them, you lose them,"" she said.

6. Hit the floor. Aging adults need to regularly practice getting down on the floor and standing back up again. ""If you don't get down on the floor and back up, you won't be able to do it after a while,"" said Van Norman.

7. Challenge your speed. While it might not seem as if folks over 60 need to worry about exercise that involves speed and intensity, they do, said Van Norman. ""Most people don't even think about speed in order to stay healthy. But tennis players are doing that all the time. You need to do something to challenge your speed, not just your power."" That's why sports like tennis can be terrific as you age, she said.

8. Believe in yourself. Faced with self-doubt and depression after several tragic, challenging events, Sharon Sultan Cutler, 71, turned to therapy to help her feel better about herself. ""The first person you have to believe in is yourself,"" said Sultan Cutler, an author. ""People like to be around other people who believe in themselves.""

9. Tackle a project. Pick a project that has meaning to you. Sultan Cutler opted to co-author (with two other writers) her first book, ""Bandstand Diaries: The Philadelphia Years, 1956-1963,"" an inside look at her once favorite TV show, Dick Clark's ""American Bandstand."" Never mind that she'd never written a book before. Now she's on her third book, ""Your New You After 65: Valuable Advice to Inspire Your Awesome Aging."" ""It's like having a daydream that you can actually make happen,"" she said.

10. Embrace self-improvement. Some call this lifelong learning. Living a healthier lifestyle requires constant learning and self-improvement, said Sultan Cutler. Seek out local learning resources like community colleges, where classes are often steeply discounted for seniors, she said. ""Self-improvement isn't just physical. It's mental, too.""","This feature is part of Music and Your Mind, a series exploring how music affects your brain. Read part 1 on behavior and part 3 on torture .

(CNN) ""People told me, 'You are changing me.' 'You are healing me,' "" Emma Smith said.

This is the feedback Smith receives on her YouTube videos , which compile gentle sounds created by touching, tapping or stroking objects, such as hairbrushes and books.

These sounds can create an autonomous sensory meridian response, or ASMR. This is a tingling sensation, usually starting in the crown of the head and moving to other parts of the body.

""Everyday objects all have a sound,"" Smith said.

The experience is caused by a range of ""triggers,"" including whispering, soft speaking, tapping, scratching, slow hand movements and close personal attention, reports one of the few studies into this phenomenon.

Not everyone experiences ASMR. Smith believes it comes down to an individuals' sensitivity to sound.

. Another But the experience was linked to a reduced heart rate and increased skin conductance levels, offering potentially therapeutic options for mental and physical health, according to a 2018 report . Another study has shown that ASMR videos can temporarily ease symptoms of depression or chronic pain in listeners.

The experience is about ""noticing things around you"" and helping people become present, she said.

Fact: Gentle sounds like this can lower heart rate, promote relaxation and work as a sleep aid according to studies.

As someone who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2013, Smith turned to YouTube in search of relaxation videos herself to help her sleep and feel at ease. ""If I was able to sleep and be calm, I was able to focus on my therapy,"" she said.

Today, Smith helps more than 670,000 video channel subscribers relax, sleep and handle pain or stress by using everyday objects to create ASMR-inducing sounds.

Smith creates ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) videos, she taps and strokes everyday objects, like a hairbrush, to create gentle sounds that can help listeners sleep, relax or concentrate.

A form of mindfulness

The exact nature of ASMR is not understood, according to a report by Swansea University, in the UK . One theory is that the tingles some people experience result from a minor seizure, but this has not been investigated.

The Swansea report found that participants who had depression used ASMR videos specifically to help them with their condition. ASMR can improve mood in depressed people because it can be considered as a form of mindfulness, according to the researchers.

People focus on the positive feelings created and focus exclusively on the present task, explain the researchers. This is similar to other mindfulness practices, like meditation, that have been shown to improve depression and chronic pain.

ASMR also helps people rest, sleep, study or focus better, Smith said. A state of pure relaxation helps people function well, she says.

Tones to relax with

Sleeplessness and insomnia is a global problem. A recent study found that people who get an average of only six hours sleep per night had a 13% higher mortality risk compared to people who enjoyed seven to nine hours. 2014 CDC figures revealed that over one third of Americans struggle to get enough sleep regularly.

It is therefore not surprising that people are searching for means to relax and help them sleep.

When it comes to healing or providing calm, lighter tones are usually beneficial for relaxing the head area, while deeper tones usually relax the body's bones, said Smith who now runs sound therapy sessions that involve people lying down and listening to chanting, gongs or other instrumental sounds.

Smith uses singing bowls to create relaxing sounds during sound bath sessions.

After a session, most people shared with Smith that they feel refreshed, balanced and more relaxed.

Smith explained that many people feel transformed as a result of being at peace for an entire hour, without any interruptions. ""When we are completely relaxed our body works at full capacity, so it is able to heal itself,"" she said.

'A massage for your mind'

One year ago, Laura Franses founded Crystal Sound Lounge in London which holds regular gong and sound bath sessions.

In a good sound bath session there will be no interruptions. If that is the case, around 75% of people reach an altered state, like a dream-like trance, according to Franses.

Franses encountered people with depression who reported feeling better after sound baths as it helped with relaxation, while people with physical injuries shared with her that they were able to relax for an hour and forget about the pain in their body.

She believes that a sound bath is essentially a ""massage for your mind"" and people leave feeling pampered and very relaxed, which produce a wide range of positive outcomes in people.

Studies into the effects of sound baths are limited, with one 2016 study observing that 62 participants felt less tension, anger, fatigue, and depressed after a sound bath, especially in first-time users.

Lyrics over painkillers?

Sound healing may be a relatively new phenomenon, but the idea of using sounds or music to address pain has been around for much longer.

Music has remained popular throughout history because of the emotional impact it has on people and its power to help regulate emotions, according to research by Daniel Levitin, professor of psychology and music at McGill University in Montreal.

The effectiveness of using music to deal with physical pain has also been clinically proven. Studies on people who underwent medical procedures, such as cardiac, colonoscopy or knee surgeries, show the patients who listened to music after their surgery having lower levels of anxiety and a lesser need for painkillers.

In one 2006 study, one group of patients who enjoyed music after their surgery was shown to need 18.4% less morphine than patients who were not exposed to music after the procedure.

This is mainly because music has the power to lift people's mood, Levitin said. A positive mood, in turn, affects peoples' serotonin production, which boosts production of natural killer cells and T cells -- both vital for a healthy immune system.

A different analysis compared the prevention of anxiety before scheduled surgery by either taking benzodiazepine sedatives or using a relaxing playlist put together by a licensed music therapist. Both groups in the trial received the same amount of care, but researchers found that the group who listened to calming songs had significantly lower anxiety levels.

Rachael Finnerty, a music therapist based in Ontario, explained that this is down to pain being an emotion, affected by a person's emotional well-being.

""Music is such a good distraction to pain,"" Finnerty continued, because ""when we are listening to music we are processing the memories and the emotions that are related to the music which makes it much more difficult for us to process the memories and emotions associated with the pain."" Because of that we can impact pain perception through music, she said.

Both music and pain use the same neurological pathways, meaning that music can override the emotions and memories that are needed to evoke pain, Finnerty explained.

Soft music that averages 60 beats per minute can be used for relaxation and to lower anxiety because our autonomic nervous system, in charge of breathing and heart rate, is engaged by music, Finnerty said. If patients focus on the music, they start to breathe to the beat of music, and their heartbeats will start to change to the beat of the music, she said.

But if the music played is linked to negative emotions, the patient will not see benefits, she pointed out. That's why using a chosen selection of music rather than one the patient has no control over will ""always have better results,"" according to Finnerty.

Music in the wake of trauma

While we are all very differently affected by music, people can benefit from music as they are dealing with emotional stress or trauma.

In the wake of the ""Black Saturday"" fires in Victoria in 2009, the most devastating bush fires in Australian history with 173 deaths reported, music therapy was used to help young people navigate the tragedy, a 2011 study says. Participants' music therapy sessions included songwriting, sharing and discussions of music.

Music therapy was an effective choice because children don't have the cognitive abilities to verbally process their emotions, but they can identify and express their feelings in music, Finnerty explained.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Music therapy offers an outlet to recognize and process emotions, according to Finnerty, who founded an education platform, the Ontario Music Therapy Academy. Through the song or lyric improvisations children can be in control. By working through the song content and changing it to reflect their situation or how they would like to feel, it will help them change their perception of the traumatic event, she explained.

Ultimately, music is effective in healing humans through a variety of means, because of its multiple yet unique effects on our mind.

It is next to impossible to listen to music and not have some sort of emotion evoked, FInnerty said.","This feature is part of Music and Your Mind, a series exploring how music affects your brain. Read part 1 on behavior and part 2 on healing .

(CNN) General Augusto Pinochet's authoritarian regime, in Chile from 1973 to 1990, was known for its kidnappings, imprisonments and torture. One prisoner remembers it all too well.

In 1975, then-24-year-old Ana María Jiménezwas held without charges at the Villa Grimaldione of the 1,168 political detention centersin Chile, known for the widespread use of torture there. Her experience was recorded in a paper by Chilean cultural historian and music researcher Katia Chornik.

One night, by her own account, musician Jiménez was forced to sing a song by Roberto Carlos, the Brazilian singer-songwriter who voiced his support for Pinochet during a 1975 performance. When she refused, she was forced to spend the entire night in the rain.

An estimated 94% of prisoners detained during the Pinochet era were tortured, according to the 2004 Valech report into political imprisonment and torture by agents of the state between 1973 and 1990. Common methods included electric shock, beatings, mock executions and witnessing the torture of others.

But for some -- like Jiménez -- there was one more element of torture: music, Chornik says.

The Valech report says music was used as a background to torture in eight detention centers, but Chornik's work shows that the use of music was more widespread; she found evidence of its use in 30 centers.

Common songs of choice in Villa Grimaldi were ""Un millón de amigos (A Million Friends)"" by Roberto Carlos and ""Gigi l'amoroso (Gigi the Ladies' Man),"" made popular by Dalida, according to Chornik.

The lyrics of ""Gigi l'amoroso"" praise the male character. The guards ""sang the song, and they loved to feel like they were Gigi,"" Jiménez described. As they come to torture prisoners, they would announce, ""here comes Gigi the ladies' man,"" she said. The guards would also put the song on at full volume while performing physical torture, she said.

The song's use in torture, as experienced by Jiménez, links to the guards' ""systematic use of sexual violence against women prisoners,"" Chornik wrote.

The slang word ""Gigi"" was used to describe the device that generated electric shocks to torture prisoners.

Jiménez remembers listening to others being punished and being subjected to the music day and night at full volume, which was ""insufferable,"" she said in her account.

Once someone goes through a torture center, they are are never the same, Jimenez said via Chornik.

""Physically, I have been left with many problems: cardiovascular, respiratory, post-traumatic alopecia, kidney difficulties, severe dental problems,"" she said. And then there is the fear -- ""that terrible feeling that never leaves you completely,"" Jimenez explained. ""You are always thinking that you can be attacked. You sleep with many frights. The anguish for what is happening in Chile, it deeply marks you, and you live with a lot of anguish, even panic crisis on certain occasions.""

""Even so, you try to overcome yourself and continue in the struggle for justice and truth and punishment for torturers, from wherever possible,"" she added.

Jiménez founded a choir in 2013 with other survivors, and it performs regularly in commemorative events in and around Santiago.

The ability to cause great pain -- and humiliation

Music has been used as a means of torture throughout history, as it has the ability to cause us great pain, said Morag Josephine Grant, a musicologist at the Reid School of Music at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.

It had different goals, including political re-education, punishment or, in Pinochet's case, for dictatorships to assert their power.

Music can cause pain because of its emotional and psychological functions, greatly affecting our self-identity and emotions, both of which are targeted in torture, explained Grant, adding no particular type or structure of music is more effective for torture.

""It tends to be music that has some type of resonance within the particular political and cultural situation,"" she said. ""The types of music that are used in torture contain a strong component of degrading and humiliating people.""

One example is female Jewish musicians forced to perform marches and classical music composed by the likes of Schubert and Bach at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.

This conjured new emotions such as anger, rage and shame, redefining the musicians' relationship with music, explained a study by Juliane Brauer, researcher at the Center for the History of Emotions at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development.

The first use of orchestras in Nazi concentration camps was in the summer of 1942, Brauer wrote. Musicians were housed in separate barracks and received more food as a reward for their work.

Female musicians played at the gates of the camps as new prisoners entered. What musicians recalled most often, according to Brauer, was the despair this situation created.

Personal accounts from musicians recorded by Brauer show the contrast between their happy memories of playing music and the use of their talent by ""the camp's machinery of death.""

This resulted in depression, serious physical illnesses and suicides, according to Brauer's research, as our bodies link music with our memory, meaning and emotions.

Overloaded by music

Loud or frightening sounds have also been shown to strengthen the effects of other torture methods, such as sleep deprivation. They can drown out the inner thoughts of detainees, resulting in loss of orientation and even hallucinations, according to research by Suzanne Cusick, professor of music at New York University.

Studies show that this type of ""sensory overload"" -- playing very loud music for long periods of time -- can be a fast way to ""break"" a prisoner because the loud noise stops the psychological process of orientation, making it hard to distinguish between reality and to resist questions from captors.

Daniel Levitin, professor of neuroscience and music at McGill University, added that it hinders the brain from organizing and making sense of information. ""The brain is constantly trying to find patterns and make order out of chaos, and presented with something it's unfamiliar with, it gets frustrated.""

Music is often applied as part of a combination of methods, such as stress position -- a position, such as forced standing or awkward sitting, held for a long period of time, causing ""excruciating pain"" -- restricting food or water and exposure to extreme cold or heat, according to Grant.

From 1967 to 1974, Greece experienced a military-style dictatorship during which culture was used to control the population. Prison camps were set up for communist ""enemies,"" and prisoners were bombarded with folk and patriotic music.

Patriotic songs,like the folk song ""Gerakina"" were used to ""re-educate"" Greeks who were on the path of communism and had lost their ""Greekness,"" explains a report by Anna Papaeti, research fellow at the University of Göttingen in Germany.

Personal accounts from prisoners describe sensory overload techniques, like playing music incessantly for 12 hours. The ""re-education"" was aimed at making prisoners ""so demoralized, confused, shattered and desperate"" that they would sign loyalty declarations to the government, according to Papaeti.

Fact: During the Greek military junta, political prisoners were forced to listen to Greek folk songs to ""re-educate"" them as Communists were seen as people who lost their ""Greek-ness.""

""It didn't even have anything to do with brainwashing. It was messing with people's sense of self,"" Grant said of this form of music torture. ""It was something that was humiliating, very degrading, and it was also very, very physically harmful. That's something that has to be remembered, as well.""

Cultural warfare

Personal accounts of detainees in Guantanamo Bay or Afghanistan, recorded in Cusick's research, described how psychological torture through music, using techniques like ""sensory overload,"" was harder to overcome than any physical torture, as prisoners knew what to expect in physical situations.

How does this song make you feel? Fact: If this song is unfamiliar to you it may have more negative effects. Unfamiliar genres are used during torture because they can be disquieting. - Excited - Irritated - Stressed - Unaffected

Psychological torture is so ""destructive to the subjects ... because they are so completely helpless in these situations,"" Grant explained.

Also torturous: if the music is unknown to the prisoner. ""Unfamiliar tonality and structure can be disquieting,"" Levitin said, likening it to being in a room where everyone speaks an unfamiliar foreign language.

Foreign prisoners in places like Afghanistan's Bagram prison were subjected to heavy metal and hip-hop, representing harsh unknown sounds and causing distress, according to one account of a former prisoner at Bagram and Guantanamo Bay.

Some music is chosen because it is particularly offensive to the prisoners' beliefs and religions. Here, it is not ""about a sound being irritating; it's about the relationship that you'd express to that sound and the context that you are being forced,"" Grant said.

One Guantanamo Bay prisoner, Muhammad al-Qatani, was subjected to weeks-long attack on his ""ability to perform the embodied practices that define a good Muslim man,"" like fasting, as part of an interrogation, according to Cusick's research.

The interrogation log of the methods used on al-Qatani shows that music, which he thought of as ""sinful,"" was used to agitate, annoy or keep him awake.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

There is no passage in the Quran forbidding music, but al-Qatani said that he felt this way because of the ninth-century teachings or hadith by an Islamic teacher, Ibn ab-ı'l-Dunya, according to Cusick's report. The hadith states that listening to music is a force that takes one's mind off devotion and removes one's thoughts from God, the research explains.

Another theological teaching claims listening to music made by a woman is unacceptable, states Cusick's report. These teachings, which clash with the Quran, have been interpreted previously, most notably by the Taliban who banned music for religious reasons, explains Cusick's writing.

The log makes a specific reference to Christina Aguilera's songs, which were used with additional techniques, like forced cross-dressing, during al-Qatani's interrogation.

Through her own research, Grant has come across people trivializing the use of music in torture situations and refusing to accept it as a serious issue.

She believes that international standard agencies and documents are not helping with people's complacency on this topic. For example, the famous Mandela rules , about minimum standards prisoners can expect, make no inclusion of sounds or music.

Torture through music ""happens in an awful lot of places, and not just in far-away places,"" Grant said. It's been used as part of punishment and humiliation tactics ""since as you early as you can think of.""","(CNN) Insect populations are declining precipitously worldwide due to pesticide use and other factors, with a potentially ""catastrophic"" effect on the planet, a study has warned.

More than 40% of insect species could become extinct in the next few decades, according to the ""Worldwide decline of the entomofauna: A review of its drivers"" report, published in the journal Biological Conservation.

Insect biomass is declining by a staggering 2.5% a year, a rate that indicates widespread extinctions within a century, the report found.

In addition to the 40% at risk of dying out, a third of species are endangered -- numbers that could cause the collapse of the planet's ecosystems with a devastating impact on life on Earth.

The report, co-authored by scientists from the universities of Sydney and Queensland and the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, looked at dozens of existing reports on insect decline published over the past three decades, and examined the reasons behind the falling numbers to produce the alarming global picture.

Its lead author, Francisco Sanchez-Bayo, of the School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Sydney, called the study the first truly global examination of the issue.

While the focus in the past has been on the decline in vertebrate animal biodiversity, this study stressed the importance of insect life on interconnected ecosystems and the food chain. Bugs make up around 70% of all animal species.

The repercussions of insect extinction would be ""catastrophic to say the least,"" according to the report, as insects have been at ""the structural and functional base of many of the world's ecosystems since their rise ... almost 400 million years ago.""

Key causes of the decline included ""habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanization,"" pollution, particularly from pesticides and fertilizers, as well as biological factors, such as ""pathogens and introduced species"" and climate change.

While large numbers of specialist insects, which fill a specific ecological niche, and general insects were declining, a small group of adaptable insects were seeing their numbers rise -- but nowhere near enough to arrest the decline, the report found.

Small creatures that run the world

Don Sands, an entomologist and retired Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization scientist, said he agreed ""entirely"" that the ""bottom-up"" effects of insect loss were serious.

""If we don't have insects as moderators of other pest populations, we have insect populations that flare up and ruin crops and make them difficult to grow,"" he said.

He added that the ecosystem at this level has ""to be in balance. That's the bottom layer and unless we address it all our lives could be impacted immeasurably.

""(Insects are) the small creatures that run the world,"" he said.

Reports of insect decline are not new: researchers have been warning of the phenomenon and its impact for years.

Last year, one study found that flying insect populations in German nature reserves declined by more than 75% over the duration of a 27-year study, meaning that the die-off is happening even beyond areas affected by human activity.

""These are not agricultural areas, these are locations meant to preserve biodiversity, but still we see the insects slipping out of our hands,"" said that report's co-author, Caspar Hallman.

Birds eating birds

Species that rely on insects as their food source -- and the predators higher up the food chain which eat those species -- were likely to suffer from these declines, according to the scientists. The pollination of both crops and wild plants would also be affected, along with nutrient cycling in the soil.

Indeed, ""ecosystem services provided by wild insects have been estimated at $57 billion annually in the USA,"" according to an earlier study

Some 80% of wild plants use insects for pollination while 60% of birds rely on insects as a food source, according to the study. Sands said an immediate danger of the insect decline was the loss of insectivorous birds, and the risk of larger birds turning from eating insects to eating each other.

In his native Australia, ""birds that are running out of insect food are turning on each other,"" he said, adding that this is likely a global phenomenon.

Bees swarm in the sky as Palestinian workers remove frames from beehives to collect honeycombs in the Gaza Strip.

Radical action needed

The report's authors called for radical and immediate action.

""Because insects constitute the world's most abundant and (species-diverse) animal group and provide critical services within ecosystems, such events cannot be ignored and should prompt decisive action to avert a catastrophic collapse of nature's ecosystems,"" they wrote.

They suggested overhauling existing agricultural methods, ""in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices.""

""The conclusion is clear: unless we change our ways of producing food, insects as a whole will go down the path of extinction in a few decades,"" they concluded.","Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) Hakeem Al-Araibi, the refugee footballer detained in Thailand, was freed from prison Monday after Bahrain announced an unexpected decision to drop its extradition case.

A Thai court approved the request to drop extradition proceedings, according to Chatchom Akapin, director general of foreign affairs for the Office of the Attorney General.

The news delighted Al-Araibi and his supporters, who had launched a global campaign calling for his release. Al-Araibi has refugee status in Australia.

Upon his release, Al-Araibi, 25, was taken to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport to fly to Melbourne.

A citizen of Bahrain, Al-Araibi was arrested and detained last November while on his honeymoon in Thailand at the request of the Bahraini government. He had been sentenced in absentia in 2014 to 10 years in prison for a vandalism charge in Bahrain. Al-Araibi fled to Australia, where he was granted refugee status in 2017. He now plays for semi-professional Melbourne-based club Pascoe Vale.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.,"(CNN) When Sina Ghanbari took to Tehran's streets during nationwide demonstrations at the beginning of 2018, he was speaking out against corruption, a sluggish economy and soaring fuel and food prices.

Ghanbari was detained during the protests. After being held in the so-called quarantine ward of Tehran's Evin prison for five days, he died on his 22nd birthday.

Prison authorities told his mother, Fatemeh Malayan Nejad, that her son had taken his own life. ""My son called me from prison. He told me they had beaten him up,"" Nejad tells CNN. ""It's a big lie that he committed suicide, and I won't rest until the truth comes out."" Ghanbari's mother says she believes he was murdered.

Ghanbari is one of nine protesters who died under ""suspicious circumstances"" after being detained by the Iranian authorities in 2018, according to a report by Amnesty International released on January 24. The rights group also says that at least 26 protesters were killed on the streets, and more than 7,000 dissidents of the regime were arrested throughout the year. Of that figure, 11 lawyers, 50 media professionals and 91 students were detained arbitrarily.

The Iranian government has not responded to CNN's request for comment.

But Iran's protest movements show little sign of abating. As security forces step up their crackdown, dissidents have continued to stage demonstrations. Rather than quashing dissent, experts say, Iran's repression may have emboldened activists.

""Protesters feel they have nothing to lose,"" says Mansoureh Mills, Amnesty International's Iran researcher. ""In the past year, we've seen thousands of workers across the country in anguish because they haven't been paid for months and are struggling to feed their families.""

""You only have to watch videos of these protests on social media and listen to workers calling out, 'We do not fear prison because we have nothing more to lose' to understand how emboldened they have become,"" Mills added.

The wave of protests in 2018

The economic protests of December 2017 and January 2018 were the largest display of public discontent in Iran since the 2009 Green Movement , when millions took to the streets to demonstrate against alleged election fraud.

But while the Green Movement attracted far larger numbers, the geographic scope of the 2017 and 2018 protests caught authorities by surprise. The demonstrators were largely from outside the capital. They gathered in major northeastern cities -- such as the conservative stronghold of Mashhad -- and in the provinces. They also largely hailed from the country's working class. Both demographics were long considered centerpieces of the regime's popular base.

""What was noteworthy was their geographical spread,"" says Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran Pulse editor at Al-Monitor. ""Equally noteworthy was the lack of elite backing: beyond general statements of sympathy for demands such as more jobs and lower consumer prices, no major political camp sided with the protesters.""

Despite the regime's violent response to the initial 2017 and 2018 demonstrations, individuals and coordinated groups of dissidents continued to publicly demand political and social reforms throughout 2018.

As Iran's economic crisis deepened, peaceful demonstrations were held during July and August which authorities dispersed by using live ammunition, tear gas and water cannons, according to Amnesty.

Teachers in Tehran held protests in October and November which resulted in 23 arrests and eight prison sentences. By the end of the year, 467 workers, including truck drivers, factory workers and teachers, had been questioned by authorities or subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.

""(The crackdown) is the worst we have witnessed over the past decade,"" Raha Bahreini, Amnesty International's Iran researcher, tells CNN.

A few brave women

Perhaps the highest-profile social movement to gain momentum during 2018 were the protests against Iran's compulsory hijab law.

On December 27, 2017, Vida Movahedi, a 31-year-old Iranian mother, climbed atop a utilities box on one of Tehran's most crowded streets and silently waved a white headscarf on a stick. She stood unveiled, her long hair flowing in the breeze.

Movahedi was arrested a few hours later, but a photograph of her solitary act went viral. The image helped galvanize exiled Iranian Masih Alinejad's ""White Wednesdays"" social media campaign. The movement encourages people to protest against the mandatory headscarf law by wearing white on Wednesdays or going out unveiled.

Vida Movahedi stands on a telecoms box on a Tehran street after removing her headscarf and holding a stick to protest against the country's compulsory hijab rules.

Through her campaign, Alinejad receives pictures and videos of these demonstrations. She then shares them on her social media accounts, which have a combined following of more than 2.3 million. Within weeks of Movahedi's act, women across the country were filming themselves unveiled on busy streets in a show of solidarity.

By the end of 2018, at least 112 female activists had been arrested or detained, according to Amnesty. Despite the arrests, the White Wednesdays movement continues today and shows no signs of subsiding.

Shaparak Shajarizadeh, 43, an active member of the movement, was arrested three times in 2018 before eventually fleeing to Turkey, and then seeking asylum in Canada. She was first detained on February 21 for sharing a video of herself online mirroring Movahedi's demonstration.

""I got beaten in the morality and security office, then they sent me to solitary confinement in jail. I was on a hunger strike for one week, then I got released,"" Shajarizadeh tells CNN. ""After that I received threatening calls -- they told me to stop posting my pictures online and speaking about the compulsory hijab laws.""

Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent human rights lawyer and women's rights defender in Iran, took up Shajarizadeh's case. While awaiting sentencing, Shajarizadeh was illegally detained by authorities again in March and May. She says she was tortured, threatened and thrown in Evin prison.

""I was accused of corruption and prostitution for posting pictures without my hijab online,"" Shajarizadeh says. ""They told me to drop Nasrin Sotoudeh as my lawyer -- threatening to charge me with national security charges against the country if I kept her.""

Shajarizadeh was sentenced to 20 years in prison, 18 of which were suspended. Sotoudeh was herself arrested on June 13, 2018, for defending several anti-compulsory hijab protesters. She faces national security-related charges which could see her sentenced to more than a decade in prison.

According to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, she is denied visits by her family. On January 23, Sotoudeh's husband, Reza Khandan, also a prominent human rights lawyer, was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison for security-related charges. Both are now appealing their charges.

US intentions

Throughout 2018, senior US administration officials -- including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- repeatedly aligned themselves with Iranian protesters to further isolate the regime.

During the wave of demonstrations in January, Trump tweeted , ""The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime."" The President then warned that the US was watching closely before declaring, ""it's time for a change.""

Pompeo seemed to take a personal interest in the anti-hijab demonstrations, and on at least two occasions in 2018 tweeted images of Vida Movahedi's protest. In June, he even posted a graphic of Movahedi next to a photo of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with the slogan ""Iranian people deserve respect for their human rights"" written over the image. The State Department also tweeted several messages in support of women's rights in Iran -- all written in Farsi.

5,000 Iranians arrested in January's protests. 30 women jailed for protesting the hijab. Hundreds of Sufi dervishes, dozens of environmentalists, 400 Ahwazis, 30 Isfahan farmers -- all imprisoned by #Iran's criminal regime.

During a speech at the Heritage Foundation in May 2018, Pompeo laid out how the US planned to proceed with Iran following the withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement. Addressing the Washington crowd he said: ""The Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly that will be wonderful.

""If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forth,"" Pompeo continued.

The cumulative effect of these actions has led Iran's President Hassan Rouhani to accuse the administration of openly agitating for regime change. ""Reducing the legitimacy of the system is their final goal,"" Rouhani said in a speech on Iranian state TV broadcast in October.

What to expect in 2019

Although more Iranians are publicly airing their social and economic grievances, the lack of organized political opposition within Iran has left analysts confident that the protest movements pose no serious threat to the regime.

""We can expect more protests in coming months as the economic situation deteriorates, but it's hard to predict where they may lead on account of their lack of organization, formulation of clear and unitary demands, and elite buy-in,"" says Al-Monitor's Shabani.

US Ambassador John Limbert, who was held captive during the 1979 hostage crisis and served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iran in 2009, is confident the regime will prevail. ""In the Islamic Republic, the authorities always feel threatened,"" says Limbert. ""They will do what they need to do to stay in power. If that requires brutality, so be it. If it means flexibility, they'll try that.""

""The same men's club has run things since 1979. Although age is catching up with them, they'll hold on as long as they can. It's clear that they are mostly clueless about the realities of their own society, where people are creative, engaged, and well-educated,"" Limbert tells CNN.

On January 29, the Worldwide Threat Assessment for 2019 was released by the US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. ""We assess that Tehran is prepared to take more aggressive security measures in response to renewed unrest,"" the document says.

As the regime looks set to dig in its heels in 2019 though, so too do some of the protesters.

One 38-year-old from Mashhad who took part in both the 2017 and 2018 protests and demonstrations in support of the White Wednesdays movement, tells CNN that despite being beaten, threatened and thrown in prison, he has no plans to remain silent in 2019. ""I will keep protesting until the removal of the compulsory hijab law, and until there's freedom for Iranian people from this despotic religious regime,"" says the protester, who declined to disclose his name for security reasons.

Amnesty International's predictions for the year ahead echo his comments. ""Iran is in the grip of an unprecedented crisis that is rooted in a confluence of severe political, economic, environmental and human rights problems,"" says researcher Bahreini.

""We can, therefore, expect that protests against poverty, inflation, corruption and political authoritarianism will grow in the country.""","Written by CNN Staff

In the midst of a red carpet season dominated by Hollywood, the Grammy Awards offered the stars of the music industry a chance to shine.

As the guests arrived at the ceremony Sunday evening, it became clear that many were out to turn heads. The Staples Center in Los Angeles came alive with bold shapes and statement pieces, alongside more elegant tailoring and paired-down chic.

Among the more outlandish looks, Cardi B's iconic dress from Mugler Couture's Fall 1995 collection stunned the crowd. Resembling a pearl emerging from an oyster, the star shuffled along the red carpet with the help of a sizable entourage.

Elsewhere, Janelle Monáe arrived in a breathtaking Jean Paul Gaultier couture dress with pointed shoulders. She completed the dramatic, angular outfit with a wide-brimmed gold-and-white hat.

The Grammys red carpet also proved, once again, to be more political than its film and TV counterparts. Singer Joy Villa turned up in a dress scrawled with the message ""Build the Wall"" (complete with a spiked metal head piece and rings of barbed wire), and Ricky Rebel attended in a similarly blunt blue jacket sporting the messages ""Keep America Great"" and ""Trump 2020.""

But, by and large, the fashion statements were playful, and the overall tone more refined than at previous Grammys.

K-pop sensations BTS opted for a clean, classic look, with the band's suave tuxedos offsetting a veritable rainbow of colorful hair. The group used the global spotlight to showcase the work of South Korean designers: Six of the band's members wore JayBaek Couture, while the seventh, rapper J-Hope, appeared in an outfit by designer Kim Seo Ryong.

A brief history of the red carpet

And there were plenty of other understated looks on display. Awards host Alicia Keys arrived in a plunging, figure-hugging red dress by Armani Privé, which she paired with elegant Bulgari jewelry. Camila Cabello also wowed in a glittering floor-length magenta gown (also by Armani Privé), before opening the show with a performance of her hit ""Havana.""

Lady Gaga took a similarly sparkling approach, although her dress was modest compared to recent red carpet outings.

Snubbing the British Academy Film Awards in London (where she won an award for her role in ""A Star Is Born"" in absentia), Gaga arrived in a stylish silver dress by Celine's artistic director Hedi Slimane. She added to the shine with more than 100 carats of diamonds by Tiffany & Co.

The huge futuristic spiral known as El Helicoide has a reputation as the country's worst torture center.

It has become a ""dark site"" where different Venezuelan police forces have their headquarters, in particular the intelligence agency Sebin and the PNB (national police). Several inmates have alleged abuses at the prison, which CNN has reported

The immediacy and horror of this situation tend to conceal a poignant structural condition that is the underlying cause of the socialist revolution led by the late Hugo Chávez and of the political impasse that afflicts Venezuela today.

El Helicoide is a microcosm of the contradictions written into Venezuela's modern history. A promise of instant ""first world"" development amid ever-expanding slums.

The book Downward Spiral: El Helicoide's Descent from Mall to Prison (2018) , which I edited along with cultural historian Lisa Blackmore, presents the history of the building and of its many failures and contradictions along with archival photography and personal testimonies that attest to the building's original grandeur and eventual collapse.

Originally conceived as a monumental showroom for the country's emerging oil and mineral industries, El Helicoide was built between 1956 and 1961 and would have been the largest and most state-of-the-art mall in the Americas.

It was constructed in South-Central Caracas on a rocky hill that was first razed into seven levels in a helicoidal, or spiral, shape. The sculpted hill was then poured over with concrete, creating two interlocked spirals with two-and-a-half miles of vehicular ramps where drivers could park in front of their stores of choice. The 645,834 square feet structure would have housed 300 upscale stores, eight cinemas, a hotel, and a heliport, among many other consumer conveniences.

At a cost of $10 million (equivalent to $90 million today), El Helicoide would have featured the technology of the time, including closed television circuits and hi-speed custom-made Austrian elevators that never made it out of their cases and were eventually looted. Its geodesic dome -- the first of those inspired by Buckminster Fuller's famous blueprint to be installed outside the United States -- was stored for 20 years before being mounted in one of the building's many failed recovery projects.

Meant to become the symbol of an ultra-modern Caracas and a rapidly developing Venezuela, El Helicoide's daring size and form were widely admired: the structure was prominently featured in MoMA's 1961 Roads exhibition on highways as a new form of architecture (with El Helicoide originally combining transportation with an exhibition and commercial center), and appeared on the covers of major international magazines.

Yet as photos of its striking models starred across the globe, the construction site in Caracas was coming to a stop. After the fall of dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez (1952-1958), the building's architects -- Jorge Romero Gutiérrez, Pedro Neuberger and Dirk Bornhorst -- were suspected of having received financial help from the military regime. Although never documented or proven, this allegation was used by the incoming democratic government, which refused to guarantee the international credits necessary to finish the structure.

El Helicoide was built in the 1950s. Photo: Julio César Mesa, 2015. Courtesy of proyectohelicoide.com Credit: Photo Julio César Mesa 2015. Courtesy proyectohelicoide.com.jpg

A complicated litigation between the construction firm, the store owners (a novel form of fundraising) and the state arose. Apparently even Nelson Rockefeller, who had several businesses in Venezuela (foremost among them the Creole Petroleum Corporation, which was for several years the most important oil producer in the world), became interested in buying El Helicoide, but red tape made it impossible. The construction firm went bankrupt and all work on the building ceased by 1961, one year short of its completion. Left in raw concrete, years of abandonment followed. In 1975, the structure passed to the hands of the state.

El Helicoide is surrounded by shantytowns, locally known as barrios, namely those of San Agustín del Sur. Like so many other barrios that now represent more than half of Caracas' built environment, this community started as shacks built by rural migrants in the mid-19th century, growing exponentially after the discovery of oil in 1918 and the industrial modernization of Caracas that started in the late 1930s.

The building's construction coincided with the wide-ranging, state-led projects created to demolish such informal housing developments at the time, and played a crucial role in the urban planning of mid-century Caracas. As such, El Helicoide's futuristic 1950s form embodied the dramatic contrast between an oil-fueled modernization, devised to propel the country from a semi-feudal economy into a 20th century industrial powerhouse, and the enormous social inequities on which this process rode. These disparities, which kept 80% of Venezuelans in misery, paved the way to Hugo Chávez's Bolivarian Revolution.

Had this self-styled socialism kept its promises, the barrios' inhabitants would have been provided with proper housing and living conditions. Instead, San Agustín del Sur is now considered one of the most dangerous shantytowns in Caracas. Its residents have suffered through El Helicoide's different phases, starting when sections of the community were razed to make way for the building; continuing with the 1979-1982 ""Great Occupation,"" when 10,000 people stayed in the building for three years in dire conditions; and enduring since 1985 a different sort of threat once the intelligence police (then DISIP, now SEBIN) was officially granted a 15-year lease for the building's two lower levels, where the prisoner's cells are located.

Although it held political prisoners since the beginning of this last occupation, El Helicoide's role as a spiral jail and torture center became publicly visible after the massive protests of 2014 and 2017, when hundreds of students were taken and retained there illegally , some for months and even years.

Venezuelan authorities have long denied cases of torture there. For instance, in May 2018 Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek Saab speaking with CNN Espanol rejected prisoners' claims of torture, extortion and minors being held inside the center.

This year, as the Maduro government has been increasingly cornered by the National Assembly and the international powers that are declaring his second mandate illegitimate, governmental repression has brutally focused on the barrios of Caracas. Their inhabitants, formerly the proud followers of a Bolivarian Revolution that gave them hope and dignity, have been the most affected by its failure. They now fight against the official armed forces of a government that claims to protect them while striking their communities with violent night raids away from TV cameras and social media.

Once hailed as the would-be icon of Venezuela's fast paced modernity, El Helicoide's downward spiral sadly represents the collapse of a national dream built on untenable social divisions.

One can only hope that both country and building will rise from their current situation and meet the challenges of a country whose vast oil reserves still hold an unfulfilled potential. For this to happen, justice must be served for the country's political prisoners, but also for its ever-present masses of urban poor.","(CNN) — If you could magically conjure up a place that's ideal for travel adventures, it would be hard to imagine anything better than what the world already has: Australia

This continent/country offers spectacular outdoor scenery, animals unlike anywhere else in the world and urban centers that compete with the top cities of Europe, North America and Asia on livability rankings.

Admittedly, as destinations go, it's not that close for most of us. But it's so worth the flight to get there.

So when you finally arrive, you want to be sure you make the most of your holiday. In no particular order, here are the best places to visit in Australia. Some of these locations have links to previous CNN Travel articles if you want to dig into the details.

Sydney

Australia's largest city is heralded as one of the world's greatest metropolises for a reason.

The capital of New South Wales plays host to the photogenic Sydney Harbour (the world's largest natural harbor), the one-of-a-kind Sydney Opera House, a lively entertainment scene and some of the best restaurants in the world.

And then there are the beaches. Bondi might be the best known, but it's just the beginning of the sun 'n' surf available near the city.

The capital of the vast state of Western Australia may be a long way from most other destinations in Australia, but Perth's remote location makes its appeal even stronger.

There's the feeling that Perth residents have long known that their city was a hidden travel gem, but it's come into its own.

Its idyllic Indian Ocean setting and weather (sunny, dry and warm most of the year) don't hurt either.

You've really entered the tropics when you're in Cairns (in Australia, the farther north you go, the warmer it tends to get).

Set along the Pacific, Cairns is the jumping-off point for the Great Barrier Reef and the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Daintree Rainforest , among other natural wonders.

The city of about 150,000 has a growing cafe scene, swimming lagoon and a relaxed vibe.

Great Barrier Reef

A rise in global temperatures continues to have a large impact on the Great Barrier Reef, but scientists are finding new ways to save the aquatic habitat. CNN's Ivan Watson explains.

The only living thing on Earth visible from space, the Great Barrier Reef was born 25 million years ago.

The world's largest reef system stretches for 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) off the Queensland coast and has 400 types of coral and 1,500 species of tropical fish.

Along with diving and snorkeling, you can also fish and island hop.

Uluru

Uluru, an intriguing sandstone monolith, is a sacred site to the indigenous Anangu people.

It's 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Alice Springs in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park . While it will be closed to climbers starting in October 2019, it remains a spectacular place to visit with many other activities that will still be available in the park.

Avid Australian traveler and retiree Heather White puts it this way: ""It's akin to climbing the Vatican or Westminster Abbey. It is a truly beautiful and spiritual place: You don't need to climb it to experience that.""

Wherever you travel , some destinations are evergreen when it comes to romance.

Here are 13 places where the landscapes and architecture are timeless, the views rightly famous -- and the romance guaranteed:

l e v a r t

The Maldives

Always hovering near the top of romantic bucket lists comes the breathtaking Indian Ocean nation of the Maldives. Sitting 600 miles southwest of India, the collection of 26 atolls boasts some of the planet's dreamiest islands, beaches, water and marine life.

Visitors can choose from more than 100 resorts, most of which are reached by speedboat or seaplane.

One of the most decadent resorts in the country, Soneva Jani is made up of two dozen overwater villas on the uninhabited island of Medhufaru.

Another resort, Jumeirah Vittaveli, lies just 20 minutes in a motorized catamaran from the country's international airport. It offers a traditional Maldivian welcome, world-class water sports, diving and beaches.

Jumeirah's newly launched Private Ocean Retreats boast a butler, overwater hammock, the longest villa waterslide in the country at 23 meters (75 feet) -- but most of all, a glass-bottomed sunken lounge that lets you enjoy stunning aquatic life without leaving the comfort of your sofa.

Castello di Ama is in Chianti, meaning that their on-property vineyards also offer wines that rank amongst the world's best.

Guests take their choice from just one of five luxury suites in the 18th-century Villa Ricucci. What's more, pieces from renowned contemporary artists such as Anish Kapoor dot the property.

Kimberley, Australia

Remote Kimberley Coastal Camp offers a true opportunity to get away from it all. Kimberley Coastal Camp

Rugged Australia may seem to some an unusual romantic destination, but the majesty of its landscapes, indigenous culture and spectacular food and hospitality quickly win over visitors.

For example, the Kimberley wilderness offers some of Australia's most exclusive and remote retreats in a vast stretch of northern Western Australia.

Kimberley Coastal Camp sits on the Admiralty Gulf and hosts just 16 guests in total, thanks to being accessible only by helicopter or float plane. If you feel like you're the only two dozen people around for hundreds of miles, it's because you are.

Hawaii is already known as one of the world's most popular honeymoon destinations, so it's no surprise that love is in the air. Countless landscapes of postcard-perfect beaches, waterfalls, mountains and more serve as the backdrop to your amorous and intimate escape.

Visitors are spoiled for choice. Maybe it's an early start to watch the sunrise from atop Maui's Haleakala Crater before a massage for two in one of Wailea's swish resorts. Surfing lessons for couples are available in a number of spots, but few destinations are as iconic as Waikiki Beach in Honolulu.

To really get away from it all, sleepy Molokai offers cozy guesthouses and gentle retail therapy, before staying up to catch the incredible night time skies and stargaze. For water babies, marine sanctuaries abound across the 50th state with incredible snorkeling and diving opportunities.

Charleston is a sultry city where a dose of true Southern charm goes a long way toward upping the romance factor. Quaint cobblestone streets, waterside dinners and carriage rides through the historic center keep visitors engaged in town.

For flower fans, nearby Magnolia Plantation is home to the United States' oldest public gardens, sharing its blooms with visitors since 1870, while Middleton Place has more than 100 acres of trails, gardens and animals.

The 400-year-old Angel Oak Tree on nearby Johns Island is a prime spot for a romantic afternoon, before maybe taking a sunset or moonlit cruise. Thanks to the city's dynamic and exciting dining scene, you can be sure of finding a table for two to toast one another.

A safari has to be one of the most romantic escapes going thanks to the call of the wild, the stunning sunsets, the solitude and the starry skies. The landlocked southern African country of Botswana is growing in popularity , not least because of its remarkable game watching opportunities.

One option is Jack's Camp, featuring 10 stylish canvas tents fitted out in 1940s designs. That means Persian rugs, brass and mahogany, as well as all modern creature comforts, despite the remote location.

When you're finished wildlife watching, the combination of luxury and serenity should ensure that romance is renewed in style.

Paris, France

If asked to name one of the world's most romantic cities, the French capital would be the first name on many lips. Of course there are iconic sights and monuments such as the Eiffel Tower , the cathedral of Notre Dame, the artist-filled streets of Montmartre or the galleries of the Louvre.

But it's also worth seeking out other lesser-known and visited spots. Musée de la Vie Romantique is a museum dedicated to 19th-century romantics in art, music and literature, complete with a secret garden, while the Musée Marmottan boasts the largest Monet collection in the world and is far less crowded than the better-known museums.

Most of all, a trip to Paris is about wandering the streets with your beloved, getting happily lost in the maze of café- and restaurant-filled lanes and courtyards of districts such as the Latin Quarter or the Marais, the latter with its beautiful and elegant square, Place des Vosges.

Istanbul, Turkey

What's better than one romantic vacation destination? How about five? Regent Seven Seas Cruises offers 10-night Mediterranean cruises hitting up some of the most romantic destinations imaginable -- think Athens, Istanbul, the Greek islands and Sicily before finishing up in the eternal city, Rome.

A day and a half in the Turkish metropolis of Istanbul is one highlight, allowing you to explore the fabled Grand Bazaar and sights including the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. The fabled Bosphorous, the stretch of water linking Europe and Asia, is another draw.

Arguably the best bit? You only need to unpack once (or get your butler to help you out) -- and you can do as much or as little as you choose.

Hoi An, Vietnam

The central Vietnamese coastal town of Hoi An may have rocketed in popularity in recent years, but even increased visitor numbers can't detract from the undeniably quaint and romantic feel of this former trading port.

The old town is a warren of ancient temples, houses and stores built around a number of canals. Gently humped pedestrian bridges let you wander hand in hand, with hundreds of multicolored lanterns above you swaying in the coastal breezes. Paper lanterns of another kind can also be lit and sent soaring skyward, along with a special message written with your valentine.

After strolling, enjoy some of the town's rightly famous foods, notably the banh mi baguette sandwiches that counted Anthony Bourdain as one of their biggest fans. His photo features prominently in a number of the spots he frequented.

Bora Bora, French Polynesia

Bora Bora is one of the world's great honeymoon locations. Tahiti Tourisme

A destination renowned for its sense of escape and privacy is the Pacific Ocean idyll of Bora Bora in French Polynesia, an hour's flight north of Tahiti.

Known as the ""Jewel of the South Seas,"" its seclusion gives the feel of a private oasis, especially in one of the overwater bungalows that have become a popular feature of the seriously swish resorts. Some even offer room service that is delivered by an outrigger canoe.

Whether you choose to kick back in the spa, shop in local villages or even skydive for the more adventurous, it's clear that the pace of life is the definition of relaxed. The only challenge for you and your valentine? Choosing which turquoise lagoon to hit next.

While it's true that visitor numbers make it unlikely you'll ever get much personal downtime along Venice's canals, some options can guarantee your own private slice of la dolce vita.

Belmond Hotel Cipriani sits on Giudecca Island, just a five-minute ride in an elegant private wooden launch from St. Mark's Square, but it's a destination that takes you light years away from the crowds. Timeless elegance and charm abound in an atmosphere of vintage glamor, beloved by fans including George and Amal Clooney.

Sip on a Bellini -- invented there -- as you take in 270-degree views over the water toward the Doge's Palace and Venice's iconic silhouette. Michelin-starred cuisine and a world-class spa complete the sophisticated and ultra-exclusive picture of romance.

Buenos Aires, Argentina

Another iconic destination for star-crossed lovers comes in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, where a mix of tango, rose gardens and riverfront dining make for an alluring destination with few rivals.

The city's most famous architecture dates from the elegant late 19th and early 20th century Belle Époque, and parks are another big draw. But for romance, nowhere can top Paseo El Rosedal. As its name suggests, it's a garden with 93 varieties of roses, walkways and benches for you and your beloved to sit a while or maybe enjoy a picnic.

The Puerto Madero neighborhood is a good choice for dinner thanks to its Río de la Plata waterfront restaurants, before late nights featuring live music and a tango show -- or maybe a dance of your own at one of the countless tango gatherings, known as milongas.

The elegant former Japanese capital of Kyoto is a hugely popular choice for amorous visitors thanks to its beguiling mix of sites, history, culture, cuisine and always-courteous approach to guests.

A number of small streams flow through the old town, making for perfect photo opportunities, especially in cherry blossom season.","(CNN) — Just when you thought superyacht designs couldn't get any more extravagant, along comes one to blow the others clean out of the water.

The Valkyrie Project envisages a spectacular, sleek vessel loaded with super-cool luxurious entertainment features that -- with a length of 229 meters (751 feet) -- would be the world's largest superyacht.

And the best part? You won't need to be a billionaire to get on board.

Valkyrie is the work of Chulhun Park , chief designer at Latvia's Latitude Yachts.

""I was determined to design a visually unique yacht which would stand out from a fleet,"" Park tells CNN Travel.

The South Korean's concept includes an on-board casino, theater, art gallery and convention hall, which will all be open to the public.

""Most people consider superyachts to be exclusive properties of billionaires to display their wealth,"" he says. ""However, such a hub would essentially be floating architecture utilized by the public.""

If built, this whopping vessel would easily eclipse the 180 meter length of the world's current largest superyacht, Azzam -- believed to be owned by United Arab Emirates President Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

It became his thesis project, supported by Monaco-based yacht designers Palmer Johnson Yachts, which employed Park before he moved to Latitude Yachts.

Valkyrie is based on Palmer Johnson's copyrighted trimaran hull, a structure that Park says lessens drag while cruising at high speeds and offers greater stability.

""Below the water line is designed by Palmer Johnson Yachts and above water line is designed by Chulhun Park,"" the designer explains.

Valkyrie would accommodate 52 guests in 26 cabins, alongside 92 crew members in 46 cabins -- although Park adds that it could hold many more day visitors.

The main material would be steel or aluminum hull and a carbon fiber superstructure.

Currently, it's just a design -- but Park says he's confident it could become reality.

""There has been genuine interest in the project,"" he confirms.","(CNN) The United States sailed two warships close to disputed islands in the South China Sea on Monday (Sunday night, ET), a move that is bound to draw the ire of Beijing.

The guided-missile destroyers USS Spruance and USS Preble sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Spratly Islands as part of what the US Navy calls a ""freedom of navigation operation.""

The operation was carried out ""to challenge excessive maritime claims and preserve access to the waterways as governed by international law,"" Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the US Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN.

""All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,"" Doss said, adding ""that is true in the South China Sea as in other places around the globe.""

Monday's operation was the second in the South China Sea reported by the US Navy this year. In January, the destroyer USS McCampbell sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands.

""They are dispersed and disaggregated, but there is leadership, there are fighters there, there are facilitators there,"" Gen. Joseph Votel told reporters traveling with him to the Middle East for his farewell tour.

Votel's comments underscore the testimony from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats before Congress, an assessment President Donald Trump has publicly disagreed with.

The statements, however, come as US backed fighters are in heavy combat in the last area of Syria where ISIS still controls territory.

""I'm very proud of the coalition force team that we have on the ground who's assisting our Syrian Democratic force partners in what will be difficult fighting,"" Votel said. ""Urban terrain, high density of explosive hazards in the area, and the presence of displaced persons and others who are attempting to depart the area.""

Nigeria's Independent Electoral Electoral Commission said more than 10,000 permanent voters' cards and 755 ballot boxes were destroyed in two fire incidents in Abia and Plateau states last week.

The INEC did not say who was responsible for the fires, but it said it had notified the Acting Inspector General of Police on the ""emerging trend of burning the electoral commissions' offices"" days before the February 16 vote.

Elections will go as ahead as scheduled in the affected states, the commission said, adding that it had made arrangements to print new voter cards to replace those destroyed in the fire.

""The Commission wishes to assure Nigerians that it will not succumb to the antics of an arsonist whose motive might create fear in the minds of voters and sabotage the conduct of the 2019 general elections,"" said INEC spokesman Festus Okoye.

Read More","Are, Sweden (CNN) Lindsey Vonn was never going to slip quietly into the sunset.

The most successful female Alpine skier in history, the greatest America has produced, barreled out of the gate and threw herself downhill for one last time and made sure her farewell race was in keeping with her golden career: historic, dramatic and filled with emotion.

The end was not triumphant, but it didn't have to be. Vonn already had her place in history.

Yet with bronze on the Swedish slopes where she won her first championship medals, the 34-year-old added polish to her concluding chapter as an elite athlete -- becoming the oldest woman to secure a medal at a world championships and the first female racer to medal at six world championships.

There was more to put in the record books, too, as she also equaled Christel Cranz and Annemarie Moser-Proll's record of five women's downhill world championship medals.

Though there was no world title, it was an impressive denouement from a woman racing with damaged knees. The bronze, she said afterwards, felt like gold. ""I skied with all my heart,"" she said.

Lindsey Vonn competes during her final race.

Going out of the gate third, the American had set the early pace. Fans burst into raucous cheers on seeing the former Olympic champion's name on top of the leaderboard and, reacting to the acclaim and her own time, she bowed to the spectators in the packed grandstand and raised her arms towards the snow-filled clouds.

Waiting at the finish line, Vonn looked on in disbelief, perching forward in her chair and covering her mouth with her hands, as racers tried and failed to surpass her time.

Olympic downhill champion Sofia Goggia could not beat her, but then came defending champion Ilka Stuhec and dreams of gold were ruined.

The Slovenian's time of 1:01.74 ensured she became the first skier to successfully defend the women's downhill since Maria Walliser in 1987 and 1989. Switzerland's Corrinne Suter denied Vonn silver.

Vonn will retire four wins short of equaling Ingemar Stenmark's record of 86 World Cup wins, a statistic which will no doubt irk such a driven individual when she reflects on her remarkable career.

Perhaps, too, she will wonder about those injury-lost years. How many more races and medals would she have won had she not been denied more time on the slopes?

Stenmark was in the Swedish resort of Are to watch the Minnesota-born skier's final race and, as a nod of recognition to the Swedish great, Vonn wore a white, blue and yellow race suit for the downhill. Her outfit also maybe indicates that the record she had been chasing is never far from her thoughts.

""I knew he was going to be in the finish because I basically begged him to come here,"" Vonn said at a crowded news conference.

""It meant so much to me to have him at the finish. He's an icon and a legend in our sport. He doesn't really like the spotlight but he deserves to have it. I was so grateful he was there. It's the perfect ending to my career.""

Competing in such a savage event has come at a cost for Vonn, wrecking her body before she was ready to quit. She wanted to continue until the end of the year, she wanted to break Stenmark's record, but in announcing her impeding retirement a few weeks ago, the American herself said she was ""broken beyond repair.""

The injuries she has sustained throughout the years read like a list doctors have to contend with in emergency rooms: a broken right arm, fractures in the left knee, broken left ankle, torn ligaments, broken bone in right leg, concussion, bruises, cuts. ""I remember I had to practice writing the alphabet every day to try to regain the use of my hand,"" Vonn once said of the nerve damage in her broken arm.

After the crashes and the falls -- even after she was helicoptered off a mountain during training at the 2006 Turin Olympics -- she has always recovered and carried on. But now the woman described this week as a ""warrior"" by her compatriot and former Olympic champion Bode Miller has had to call it a day.

Lindsey Vonn looks to the sky after completing her final race.

She was filled with anxiety, she admitted, before the downhill, battling with an internal monologue, the crash she suffered in Tuesday's super-G still playing with her mind: would rolling the dice culminate with her in the fencing once again or could she stay calm and execute her plan? Thankfully for Vonn, it was the latter.

""I wanted more than anything to finish strong,"" she said, before insisting she wasn't disappointed with a bronze.

""I'm in a position where my body isn't allowing me to ski the way I know I can. Normally, I'd say, yes, I'm disappointed because I know I can win but I don't know that I can win anymore and that's why I'm retiring. That's the best I could've done today. There's not another gear.

""It's not an easy thing to feel your bones hitting together and pushing through it. I think I skied pretty well. Even before the crash I was sore -- my neck is killing me. I knew I was capable of pushing through the pain one last time and I did that.""

Vonn is admired by her peers and fans because she is the most human of champions; transparent, emotional, not afraid to cry. On her last day as an Alpine skier, however, there were no tears.

She embraced her father, Alan, and sister, Karin, near the finish line, lifted one of her dogs in the air as she herself was balancing on the shoulders of others. Her fellow racers signed her bib, Stenmark gave her a bouquet and in below-zero temperatures she negotiated the maze of reporters waiting for her with equanimity, telling them she wasn't going to miss the bone-chilling cold and how she was looking forward to the evening's party.

She smiled, she laughed, but admitted: ""I want to cry, but I can't cry anymore.""

Over the last few weeks fellow racers have spoken about the American's legacy. Her desire to race against men, said Aksel Lund Svindal, chimed with everyone who wanted equality, while Stuhec said Vonn had made it OK for female racers to be feminine and athletic. ""She never acts like she is on Olympus, where she could be,"" Goggia said of the American last year after winning Olympic gold.

Vonn has been appreciative of the glowing tributes. ""That's the coolest thing that's happened in the last few weeks, how much support I've got from the other athletes and how much respect they've shown me. That, to me, means more than any World Cup win,"" she said.

Fans in Are also echoed the sentiments of Vonn's peers. Veteran Alpine skier Anna Maria Dahlstrom, whose home is 600km away in Stockholm, had come to watch Vonn and made a placard which read: ""Thank you, Lindsey. Forever a star.""

""She's superwoman. There's no-one like her,"" said the 43-year-old. ""I've never made a sign like this before but I just felt in my heart that Lindsey deserves a sign.""

Vonn is not only the most famous skier of her generation, but she appeals to all generations. Eleanor Bodin, 21, holding aloft a ""Thank you Lindsey"" poster, predicted there'd be an emptiness in the post-Vonn era. After all, she does not remember Alpine racing without her hero hurtling down vertiginous slopes.

""It really feels sad,"" said Bodin. ""Women's ski racing has grown because of Lindsey.""

But it would probably more accurate to say Alpine skiing has grown because of Vonn.

She retires having won more World Cup races than any other woman and no female racer has more Olympic medals than Vonn's two in the hair-raising downhill. Had she not suffered a ghastly knee injury -- a torn ACL and MCL with a tibial fracture -- when 29 and in her prime before Sochi 2014, Vonn may have won a third in the event.

As a 17-year-old, Lindsey Kildow -- five years before the marriage that would change her name to Lindsey Vonn -- finished sixth at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. The largely unknown teenager's performance raised eyebrows, and later she told reporters that at school she had written of her plan to ""make it to the Olympics and win more ski races than any woman ever has.""

Vonn certainly achieved her childhood ambition, though the journey has not been smooth.

Four years after Salt Lake, when she was expected to win multiple medals, Vonn crashed in Turin and later admitted she had feared her career was over. Unshakable, she still competed, but her best finish was seventh.

Over the next five years, having married Thomas Vonn, a US ski racer who became her coach, Vonn developed into the most dominant skier in the sport, winning four World Cup overall titles and, at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, becoming the first American to win the women's Olympic downhill.

In 2011 she separated from her husband, missed several races through illness then took a month-long break from the World Cup. More pitfalls followed. A year from the Sochi Olympics, she ruptured her cruciate ligament in her right knee, returning nine months later only to fall at high spend during training and rupturing the same ligament in her right knee.

""That's the best I could've done. There's not another gear. I knew I was capable of pushing through the pain one last time and I did that.""@lindseyvonn puts her name in the history books once again with downhill bronze in her final race. https://t.co/qtNddFyO7j pic.twitter.com/11R2Pu7Hmr — CNN Sport (@cnnsport) February 10, 2019

""A very dark moment in my career,"" was how Vonn described the period.

Around this time she started dating Tiger Woods, which elevated the skier into another level of stardom (the pair announced their split in May 2015). Her achievements on the slopes and her celebrity off it has led to commercial success. She has multimillion dollar deals with Under Armour and Red Bull, while she also has a foundation awards financial grants to young people to help pay for ""education, sports and enrichment programs."" Life after skiing has already taken shape.

She has said she will set up her own business and last year attended a four-day course at Harvard Business School. Vonn has also spoken of her dreams of acting with 'The Rock'.

This week she was asked whether she had any plans to start a family and took the question as an opportunity to set up her phone so that her boyfriend, NHL Nashville Predators defenceman P.K. Subban, could listen in on the news conference before saying ""Yes, of course I'd love to have children.""

For now, Vonn is looking forward to no longer having to do daily five-hour strength and conditioning workouts in the gym. She will, she says, rest, watch Law and Order, and undergo what will hopefully be a final operation on a ski injury.

""I was scared before of life without skiing and it's taken me a while to get to this point where I'm happy with it,"" she said.

""I'm not nervous about it. I've got a lot to look forward to. In the real world I'm actually pretty young. I've felt old for a long time because I'm racing with girls who are a lot younger than me, but I've a lot to look forward to so I'm excited.""","Written by Abigail Cain

There's a reason that ghost towns are empty. Maybe a nearby precious resource, like oil or gold, was wholly depleted. Perhaps it was a natural disaster, or a man-made one. The highway was rerouted, or the river diverted. Maybe disease struck, or famine.

Whatever the cause, the resulting tableaus of decay and desolation have fascinated artists for centuries. Renaissance painters were captivated by Roman ruins, including the Forum and the Colosseum; artists in the 19th century were obsessed with the remains of ancient Egyptian civilizations unearthed by archeological expeditions. Below, we've gathered a more contemporary cohort interested in capturing abandoned urban spaces.

From Africa to the American Midwest, here are four photographers resurrecting ghost towns.

Noel Kerns

""It's almost all trespassing,"" American photographer Noel Kerns told Slate of his shoots. ""Seldom do I have permission. It's easier to ask forgiveness if you need it. In general, most people don't care, and most people don't find out."" Kerns, who is based in Dallas, Texas, has been capturing the abandoned houses, churches, and schools of American ghost towns since 2007, when he learned the technique of ""light painting,"" a style of night photography that incorporates artificial lighting and long exposures to create images awash in color.

In Kern's work, derelict and dilapidated buildings appear to glow from within, illuminating empty windows and doorways in shades of red or blue. They're undeniably uncanny -- but Kerns said he doesn't often feel spooked during these trips, even while shooting alone in the dark. ""It's probably disappointing to most people, but in general, it doesn't bother me as much as you would think,"" he said.

There have been a few notable exceptions, though: an old hotel in Detroit where he couldn't shake the sense he was being followed; an empty church in Gary, Indiana, where he walked over something sticky that, upon closer inspection, appeared to be partially dried blood. ""That was an extremely uneasy feeling,"" he recalled.

French photographer Romain Veillon has been fascinated by abandoned spaces since childhood, when he spent his summers exploring an old truck factory owned by his grandmother. Now, his practice centers around capturing the beauty of these forgotten, deteriorating sites. ""When I encounter such a place,"" he explained, ""my goal is that everybody can travel in the past with me and make up their own stories: Why was this place abandoned? What happened to the former owners? What used to happen in this room?""

The questions are particularly compelling in the case of Kolmanskop, a former diamond-mining town in Namibia where sands have partially reclaimed the buildings. Established in 1908, the town quickly became a hub of the region. Legend has it that the diamonds were so plentiful, one could simply stroll across the sand at night to find the precious stones sparkling in the moonlight.

But following World War I, a drop in the price of diamonds and the discovery of a larger deposit in the south pulled people away. By 1956, the town was abandoned. Today, small tour groups visit around noon each day, but Vellion said that for the most part, it is quiet and empty. During the week he spent shooting in Kolmanskop, he would arrive around 5 a.m. ""to watch how the sun changed the colors of the rooms little by little,"" he said. ""The atmosphere was completely unreal, you feel like it is another planet; or maybe Earth, but centuries after the last man has disappeared.""

According to local legend, the town of Picher, Oklahoma, was created by accident. In 1914, the Picher Lead Company of Joplin, Missouri, sent workers to deliver equipment to a site in Oklahoma. Their truck got mired in the mud, however, and to relieve their boredom, the men drilled a hole. Surprisingly, they hit something -- a thick vein of zinc and lead. The company set up shop, and the town of Picher sprung up around the new mines.

By the 1920s, the area was the country's number-one producer of the two metals and the source of most metal used in ammunition in World War I and II. When the mines began to run dry in the 1960s, most companies packed up and left. In the end, however, that wasn't what killed the town: The mining had resulted in extremely high levels of lead poisoning among residents, along with a spike in cancer rates, leading the Environmental Protection Agency to dub the town and its surrounding area the most contaminated place in America. The government began buying out residents' homes in 2005, closing the town for good in 2009.

American photojournalist Seph Lawless has visited Picher several times over the years. The town is technically closed off, and for good reason -- extensive mining underneath much of the town made the ground unstable and prone to collapse.

""At one point, my foot actually fell through the ground as a huge sinkhole began opening up and I jumped to safety,"" Lawless recalled. ""There's an eerie silence as I walked around the ghost town alone. I didn't hear birds or see any signs of life -- it was surreal."" The wind blew tiny bits of rock against his face. Known as chat, this fine gravel is a byproduct of zinc and lead mining, and huge mounds of it ring the town like a mountain range.

The photos reveal a desolate town, made up of a handful of dilapidated buildings that line a road of cracked asphalt. The clouds are threatening, hanging low and dark against the sky. But the interiors are equally apocalyptic: Brightly patterned clothes are hung up, left behind by a previous tenant -- a reminder of the residents who were paid to move out of the town. In one abandoned front yard, a lone wicker chair remains.

Lawless hopes that his work will bring wider attention to the devastation. ""I think people look at America, and we look at the skyscrapers and New York City, and we think America is great,"" the photographer told Musée Magazine last March. ""And we are a great country -- I love my country to death, I really do. But hiding in the shadows (are) crumbling areas of my country that I want people to not forget about, too.""

1 / 8 Photographer and filmmaker Valérie Anex documented unfinished housing developments that were abandoned during the recession in Ireland. Credit: Valerie Anex

From the mid-1990s through the late 2000s, the Irish economy experienced a growth period so ferocious, it was dubbed the ""Celtic Tiger."" The housing market was particularly brisk: Homes were being built in unprecedented numbers, at a per-capita rate four times higher than that of the United States. Then, in 2007, things started to go south: The bubble burst, and properties built on cheap, rural land could no longer be sold; sometimes, the investors were so broke that they couldn't complete the projects.

Thus, Ireland came to be littered with thousands of so-called ""ghost estates"" -- by 2011, they numbered more than 3,000. Among them, 621 housing developments were, at most, only half finished or occupied. (Since then, the number has been dramatically reduced, according to a 2017 report.) Photographer and filmmaker Valérie Anex, who was born in Switzerland and is now based in Berlin, first encountered the phenomenon during a visit to her grandmother's home in 2010.

The following year, Anex spent three weeks driving across northwest Ireland to photograph the ghost estates. It wasn't hard to find them, she said -- she simply followed the billboards on the highway advertising houses for sale. She also checked online, where outraged citizens were using Google Maps to compile lists of these empty housing developments.

It wasn't an enjoyable experience. ""Sometimes I wondered, 'Why am I doing this? It's so creepy,'"" she recalled. ""Every time I left one of these estates, I had this feeling of relief, thinking I'm so happy I'm not living there, I don't have to spend any more time here.""

Yet there were (and still are) people living among these ghost estates -- homeowners who bought their property at the peak of the housing bubble and can now only sell for a fraction of the price. ""They are basically kept captive in this sad environment,"" Anex noted. Although she encountered many of these people during her shoot, she didn't include them in her series because, as she reasoned, ""the system is not made for people. (The ghost estates are) a symptom of the capitalist economy going wild, going on credit; there was no real demand for these houses. These houses were not made for anyone.""","Vinicius Junior had a silvery smile when he landed at Madrid's Barajas airport in the summer, a couple of days after turning 18 years old.

His new employers, Real Madrid, were delighted to see him in such a positive mood. But after finally unveiling him to the fans, the team made a demand: The braces on his teeth had to go.

The Spanish giants were worried the Brazilian forward could get seriously hurt if he were hit by an elbow during a game, and he was a prized new asset they needed to protect.

The previous year, Real Madrid agreed to pay Rio de Janeiro side Flamengo an astonishing €45 million ($51 million)—and potentially €61 million ($69 million)—for Vinicius when he was still just 16.

He had made his first-team debut for Flamengo only 10 days earlier and had played a grand total of just 17 minutes of senior football.

Still, Real Madrid knew they had to have him, even though international transfer rules meant he could not move to Europe until he turned 18.

Vinicius went on to play nearly 70 games at Flamengo, a club in mourning after 10 young players died at their youth team training centre on Friday.

Vinicius tweeted about the incident saying: ""Just remembering the nights and days I spent at the training centre, it gives me goosebumps. I still can't believe it, but praying for all! May God bless everyone's family!""

Real Madrid manager Santiago Solari admitted his player was affected by the tragedy, but he still trusted Vinicius with a starting place in Saturday's Madrid derby, and the youngster won a penalty in a significant 3-1 win over Atletico.

PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU/Getty Images

Getting rid of the braces was the first demand Real Madrid put on Vinicius this season, but it hasn't been the last.

With Cristiano Ronaldo leaving for Juventus and manager Zinedine Zidane also departing the club after a third successive Champions League title, former Spain coach Julen Lopetegui was brought in to try to reconfigure the team.

However, he clearly saw Vinicius as part of the future, not the present.

Under Lopetegui, Vinicius played just 12 minutes in two substitute appearances. It appeared he would have to settle for lining up for Castilla—Madrid's reserve side—who play in the Spanish third tier.

But after a few months, everything changed. Lopetegui was sacked following a disastrous four-and-a-half months in charge, and new head coach Solari has put his faith in Vinicius. Since then we've been witnessing the meteoric rise of a prodigy.

Last week, in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final, Vinicius became the club's youngest player to be featured in a Clasico against Barcelona in the 21st century.

He wasted no time proving his future is now. As he touched the ball for the first time at the Camp Nou, an almost deafening whistle from around 92,000 fans was heard. But he needed only six minutes to silence them, combining with Karim Benzema to set up a goal for Lucas Vazquez in the 1-1 draw.

MB Media/Getty Images

He's been involved in eight goals for Madrid in the Copa del Rey this season, scoring twice and providing six assists.

He has also emerged as a regular starter in La Liga and is primed to play his first UEFA Champions League knockout tie when Real Madrid travel to Amsterdam to face Ajax on Wednesday.

Vinicius brought his whole family—father, mother, sister, two brothers, niece and uncle—with him from Rio de Janeiro to Madrid. They live in a mansion with a basketball court in La Moraleja, an affluent residential neighbourhood near the club's facilities.

Teammates Benzema, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo, Casemiro and Luka Modric all live next to him, which is handy since Vinicius still doesn't have a driver's license and relies on lifts from his new pals to get him to Real Madrid's Valdebebas training ground.

Some of his new teammates are almost as old as his dad, Vinicius Jose Paixao de Oliveira, a 37-year-old cabling technician.

Oliveira came from a humble background and worked hard his entire life to be able to take his four kids out of one of Rio's most dangerous favelas, Portao da Rosa, where they lived in a four-room house during Vinicius' first 15 years. Oliveira once even left the family and moved to Sao Paulo on his own to take a job to make more money for the family.

When Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazi's most popular newspaper, recently asked Oliveira about the possibility of taking some photos at his old residence, he advised them not to go there because drug dealers would probably be around.

His relatives avoid speaking to the media too. For safety reasons, they don't want to draw attention to themselves. The loved ones of Brazilian footballers have been kidnapped for ransom in the past.

Family support is a key part of the Vinicius story.

""Vinicius Junior is a diamond in the rough,"" Gilmar Popoca, a former midfielder who worked as Vinicius' coach in the U13, U17 and U20 age groups, tells Bleacher Report. ""I have no doubt he's going straight to the top. If you ask me why I'm so sure about that, I would recommend getting to know his family.""

Alexandre Loureiro/Getty Images

Popoca knows what it is like to be highly touted. He was named player of the tournament at the 1984 Summer Olympics and was compared to the great Zico as he helped Brazil win the silver medal. However, that was as good as it got for him during what turned out to be a journeyman career.

""The same won't happen to Vinicius,"" Popoca confidently predicts.

""Back in my time, there wasn't so much money around; there's plenty of it now. And it can be a problem, bringing arrogance with it, an attitude that can harm a career,"" he adds. ""But despite the €61 million price tag he carries, Vinicius remains calm, very simple, surrounded by people like his father, who are very down-to-earth and will not let him get carried away by the fuss.""

Vinicius Junior loves tattoos, but his father is not the biggest fan.

On Wednesday, when Real Madrid face Ajax, Oliveira will watch the game closely, knowing there is more at stake for his son than a possible advantage for the second match at home.

That's because father and son have a deal—a tattoo for every significant milestone Vinicius reaches in his career. The first one came after he made his professional debut, and two more have followed.

Vinicius will be entitled to a fourth if he scores on the European stage for the first time.

Even when it comes to off-the-field passions such as tattoos, Vinicius' father has managed to transmit it into on-the-field focus.

The way Vinicius has settled into European life reminds former Brazil youth football coordinator Erasmo Damiani of Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus, who quickly settled in the Premier League after arriving at City in 2017 as an 19-year-old from Sao Paulo side Palmeiras.

MB Media/Getty Images

""Vinicius' potential is so huge that I think he can perfectly establish himself even before Gabriel Jesus did,"" Damiani, who watched Vinicius climb from Brazil's U15 to U20 team, tells B/R. ""I used to hear people saying in our meetings, 'He's very good, has so much potential, but he's a bit distracted sometimes.' As long as it is not for negative things, why should we even discuss it? He has always been an extroverted boy and matured a lot throughout his time with us.""

When Vinicius has the ball, you have the feeling something might happen. He's willing to take risks and run at defenders, which brings to mind great Brazilian players such as Neymar, Kaka and Ronaldinho.

In Spain, he's starting to fill the Ronaldo void in the hearts of the Madridistas. He's been the main man responsible for the change of mood at the club. The Bernabeu was a sad, quiet place earlier in the season, but Vinicius has brought the buzz back.

Vinicius' journey also mirrors that of Savio. Back in 1998, Savio also left Flamengo for Real Madrid. He returned home with three Champions League titles.

The former left-winger, now a 45-year-old businessman, met Vinicius before he moved to Europe and liked what he saw.

""He came here with his uncle [Ulysses Leao], a very kind and simple man. Despite being only 18, he gave me the impression he was already focused on his goals, what he had to do out of the pitch, something that you don't expect from a kid of his age,"" Savio tells B/R.

Savio's main advice to Vinicius? Get used to the cold Madrid winters, and get the fans on your side.

""My main problem was the weather—I left Rio in the summer and arrived in Madrid to train with zero degrees. It wasn't easy,"" he recalls. ""What really helped me is that I had the support from fans since the beginning; it was very important, gave me the confidence I needed. I see the same affection towards Vinicius now. The Bernabeu can be a very complicated stadium to please, with pressure everywhere. Either the fans fall in love for you or hate you.

""Right now, I'm sure they're in love with Vinicius.""

The hype is certainly building. Just last week, a column by Marco Ruiz in Spanish newspaper AS proclaimed ""a new era is approaching at Madrid—it is the Vinicius era."" Is the teenager prepared for such a leading role?

Tostao knows a bit about talent. A key member, alongside the likes of Pele and Jairzinho, on Brazil's celebrated 1970 World Cup-winning team, he is now one of the country's leading football pundits.

""[Vincius] is still young but physically ready, extremely fast, with very impressive sprinting,"" Tostao tells B/R. ""It's been a while since I saw a player with his pace and control of the ball. He's not a promise anymore; he's a reality.""

However, Tostao also urges caution. ""It remains to be seen, however, how far he will go—if he will be an excellent player, something he has already proved to be, or will reach the level of the biggest footballers in the history.

""It's impossible to predict this now. He still makes some poor decisions. I'm not sure if that's because he's too young or due to some weakness on his game.""

With his displays at the Bernabeu, Vinicius has managed to silence critics back home who predicted he would not live up to the expectations.

After some patchy early performances at the club when he was still just 16, some critics labelled Vinicius ""Neguebinha"" (meaning ""little Negueba""). Negueba was another Flamengo graduate who seemed destined for greatness, but who is languishing in South Korean football.

""When some fans and even certain people in the media started referring to him as Neguebinha, I warned them: 'It doesn't make any sense. This boy is different. He is still only 16,'"" Damiani says. ""'Why are you putting so much pressure on him? He has a huge potential.' Not to mention he always finds a way to overcome adversity—that's what makes him so special.

""Some people in Brazil seem to get satisfaction from criticising young players, underestimating them, but I think Vinicius is now shutting them up.""

Gareth Bale, for whom Real Madrid paid a world-record fee to acquire in 2013, was often seen as the heir apparent to Ronaldo, but Vinicius has been outdoing him this season and seems to have little concern about losing his place now the Welshman has returned from injury. He often cites a quote from Michael Jordan as his motto: ""Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""

The Brazilian has started the club's last 11 matches and is in such amazing form that Madrid seem to be him plus 10 at the moment.

While the Spanish title might be beyond Real Madrid's reach (they are still six points behind Barcelona despite closing the gap in recent weeks), Vinicius' rapid development has helped spark hope of a fourth consecutive Champions League title.

And where will this year's final take place? In Madrid, at the home of their city rivals Atletico, on June 1. What a place that would be for Vinicius to flash that smile one last time this season.

Georgia landed one of the most sought-after prizes on the recruiting trail Monday when shooting guard Anthony Edwards joined its 2019 class.

""Two of my favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, were coached by Tom Crean, and he's a great coach,"" Edwards told 247Sports' Evan Daniels. ""They came in, not highly rated, and came out really good. It weighed big on me.""

""I went to a game and I felt the fans in the gym, everybody showing love, and I felt like I was home,"" Edwards added. ""My sister just had my nephew, I want to see him grow, so [staying close to home] was a big factor.""

According to 247Sports' composite rankings, Edwards is a 5-star prospect and the No. 2 overall player, No. 1 shooting guard and No. 1 player from the state of Georgia in his class.

The 6'5"" and 215-pound playmaker reclassified from the 2020 class to 2019 and still finds himself near the top of the recruiting rankings as he prepares for the next step of his basketball career.

NBADraft.net has Edwards as the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft. ESPN's Jonathan Givony has him slotted at No. 2.

Many of the sport's ultimate blue bloods—Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Michigan State and UCLA—were featured when he cut his list to eight in November, underscoring his talent level and the type of programs interested in him.

Daniels noted Edwards posted 21 points and 6.1 rebounds a night as a member of Atlanta Xpress while playing on the Under Armour circuit. He also drilled 45 percent of his three-point attempts.

Edwards' combination of size and shooting ability makes him an almost impossible matchup.

He can either shoot over smaller defenders or overpower them by driving into the lane and playing through contact. However, bigger defenders have difficulty keeping up with his quickness and countering the separation he creates with his ball-handling.

The shooting guard can also help his frontcourt teammates battle for rebounds and either keep possessions alive or look for transition opportunities going the other way. His length and athleticism figure to help on the defensive end as well, seeing how he can challenge jump shots and cut off penetration.

Edwards is the type of playmaker who can step on campus and immediately elevate to the position of go-to option. The NBA could well be in his not-too-distant future given his skill set, and he possesses the talent to become a household name in the collegiate ranks.

Georgia hopes he delivers on that talent and helps it compete against formidable programs such as Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee and Auburn in the SEC.

The Bulldogs haven't been to the NCAA tournament since the 2014-15 campaign and are looking to change the direction of the basketball program in the coming years. Landing playmakers like Edwards, especially when they are from Georgia, is the road map to doing just that.","Charlie Riedel/Associated Press

The Oakland Raiders are entering year two of a ground-up rebuild under new (old) head coach Jon Gruden. The team is flush with draft picks after it traded star edge-rusher Khalil Mack and standout wide receiver Amari Cooper—and equally flush with roster holes.

After Derek Carr's tumultuous fifth season, which included a 4-12 record, sideline dustups with his head coach and a challenge to fight an ESPN personality, there was speculation that Oakland's rebuild might include severing ties with the quarterback via either a trade or the 27-year-old's outright release.

That idea has been tabled. Per Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, Carr's $19.9 million salary for 2019 became fully guaranteed Wednesday. Gruden's engineered some dubious personnel decisions since he took over the Raiders in January 2018, but staying the course with Carr was more than just the right play.

It was the Raiders' only play.

John Hefti/Associated Press

It been clear for a while that the reports of Carr's Raiders demise were exaggerated. In December, Gruden told Scott Bair of NBC Sports Bay Area that despite a lack of team success, he was pleased with Carr's performance in 2018:

""I think Derek has played great. Somebody told me he had 3,700 yards and 68 percent completions in 13 games. That's astonishing. With three new guards, losing a right tackle, a featured back, three top receivers. The guy is a hell of a player. The guy is a great quarterback. We are very pleased and proud of what he has done. We know we got to get better around him, and that we will.""

However, that vote of confidence didn't stop ESPN's Max Kellerman from suggesting the Raiders should cut or trade Carr and draft Oklahoma's Kyler Murray.

""Pretty obvious, Carr is not the long-term answer there,"" Kellerman said. ""You could see that, especially the first half of the season. I mean, I stopped watching Carr a lot the second half of the season; who cares about the Raiders' second half? But the first half of the season, he looked shell-shocked. He looked like a quarterback who had quit.""

It seems the assertion that Carr had ""quit"" caused him to challenge Kellerman to a fight.

Offering to get into the Octagon with a TV personality isn't the best way to handle criticism—whether that criticism is fair or not. But that misstep was a rare one for Carr over the second half of last season.

Despite playing behind a subpar offensive line with arguably the NFL's worst skill-position talent while withstanding a constant barrage of criticism of everything from his toughness to his relationship with coaches and teammates and his future with the franchise, Carr overcame a rocky start to post a solid statistical season—all things considered.

For the year, Carr set career highs in completion percentage (68.9), passing yards (4,049) and yards per attempt (7.3). His passer rating of 93.9 was the second-highest of his career, bested only by the 96.7 he posted in his 12-win 2016 season.

From Week 6 to Week 16, Carr went 10 straight games without throwing an interception.

Yes, he only threw 19 touchdown passes. And the Raiders only won four games. But those numbers say less about Carr than the talent (or lack thereof) around him. The team's leading receiver in terms of yardage was veteran tight end Jared Cook (896). He was tied for the lead in catches with scatback Jalen Richard (68). Jordy Nelson was the only Raiders wideout with even 500 yards. Oakland was 25th in the NFL in rushing at 101.8 yards per game.

Gary Landers/Associated Press

Oh, and Carr was sacked 51 times—the third-most in the league. Other than that, though, everything was fine.

There aren't many quarterbacks who could succeed with next to nothing around them. And even if the Raiders have decided Carr's not their long-term answer, it's not like a better option for the 2019 season is available.

Yes, the Raiders have the fifth-most cap space in the NFL (about $71.2 million, per Over the Cap)—plenty to take a run at a veteran free agent. And with Carr under contract through 2022 at an average of less than $20 million per season (relatively modest by today's standards), if the Raiders seriously shop him, finding a taker likely wouldn't be that hard.

But flipping Carr and acquiring a veteran stopgap wouldn't get the Raiders any closer to respectability. Just about any vet the team could sign would be a step down from Carr. Adding more draft picks at the expense of a downgrade at the NFL's most important position wouldn't make much sense for a team that's already swimming in selections the next couple of years.

Frankly, neither would burning one of the team's three first-round picks on a young quarterback—not this year, anyway.

It may well be that one day we'll look back at Murray, Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins or one of this year's other young signal-callers as a relative bargain. And with the fourth overall selection, the Raiders could probably have their pick of the litter. But there's nothing resembling a sure bet in this class—as a whole, it's viewed as a weaker crop than both the 2018 and 2020 groups.

That latter class could include Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa, Oregon's Justin Herbert and Georgia's Jake Fromm—and if the Raiders really want a new quarterback of the future as opposed to their old quarterback of the future, that's where they should look.

Let's be real for a moment: Regardless of how well Carr plays in 2019, the Raiders won't be a good team. Even with a bucketful of draft picks and cap space out the wazoo, there are too many holes to fill. Oakland also has two picks in the first 32 in 2020, and one of those will be a high selection.

The best course of action—the wisest course of action—at quarterback this year is to maintain the status quo. Give Carr one more chance to show 2016 wasn't an aberration. That he can be the quarterback to lead the Raiders out of the AFC West basement. Use all those picks and all that cap space to build around him. Improve the O-line and weapons at Carr's disposal.

Gary Landers/Associated Press

He is, after all, the only quarterback to lead Oakland to the postseason over the last 16 years.

If it works out, great—the Raiders will have one less thing to worry about and can continue to build around him. If it doesn't, then Oakland won't be any worse off. Assuming the bottom doesn't fall out, there will still be a trade market for Carr's services. If it does, they can cut bait before next March's deadline for his salary to vest.

None of this guarantees that Carr really is the Raiders' long-term solution. Nor does it mean that Gruden's renovation project is anywhere close to finished. But by giving Carr one more year to show that he can be the guy, Gruden's at least allowing that he isn't sure Carr's not.

And that might just be the wisest move Gruden's made since he returned to the Silver and Black.","Ben McKeown/Associated Press

After decades of college basketball fans complaining about the use of an outdated and unfair rating percentage index (RPI) in the NCAA tournament selection process, a new team ranking system called the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET) was implemented for this season.

Thus far, it's unclear whether this is an improvement.

We won't bore you with the details of how the NET is calculated because, well, we couldn't if we wanted to. The NCAA has been tight-lipped about how the sausage is made. When the switch to the NET was originally announced in August, we were told there would be five components:

Team Value Index (the results-oriented portion of the formula, which factors in strength of schedule) Net Efficiency (points scored and points allowed on a per-possession basis) Winning Percentage (overall D-I winning percentage) Adjusted Win Percentage (accounting for locations of games) Scoring Margin (capped at 10 points)

That's all the transparency we have been given, and it left more questions than answers.

There's no indication of how the five factors are weighted, and there is no NET score as far as the public has been shown. We can look at RPI scores or vote totals in the AP poll and get a sense of how wide or narrow the gap is between two teams, but we have no clue with NET. The NCAA simply puts out an updated ranking at some random time between 9 a.m. ET and 4 p.m. each day.

That secrecy might be the most annoying part of it all, and it is already resulting in some unorthodox late-game coaching decisions:

While no one understands the minutiae of the changes, the general idea is that margin of victory matters now—and it matters way too much as far as my two cents are concerned.

Back in the RPI days, a one-point win at the buzzer looked the same as a 40-point blowout. As a result, there were vast differences when comparing RPI rankings to predictive analytics such as KenPom.com, ESPN's BPI and Sagarin, which are grounded in net efficiency and margin of victory.

But it was clear from the first NET rankings release Nov. 26 that too much emphasis was being placed on scoring margin. Ohio State was No. 1, thanks in no small part to home wins over Purdue Fort Wayne, South Carolina State, Samford and Cleveland State by an average margin of 29.8 points.

You might be thinking: ""But the NCAA said the scoring margin would be capped at 10 points, so who cares if teams are winning by 10 or 50?""

That's a great point, but there is no cap on net efficiency (as far as we know), which is just scoring margin presented at a per-possession level. And with no knowledge of how each of the five factors is weighted, it's possible that scoring margin is 50 percent of the ranking process.

Basically, we went straight from margin of victory playing no part in the selection/seeding process to counting it twice, and that is producing some bizarre rankings.

Eric Gay/Associated Press/Associated Press

Kansas has played the toughest schedule in the country without a close runner-up. The Jayhawks have taken more than their fair share of lumps on the road lately, but they have eight Quadrant 1 wins and a combined 13 Quadrant 1 and Quadrant 2 wins. In both categories, that's the most in the nation. And because of that, they are No. 1 in RPI in spite of the six losses, and they would likely be projected for a No. 1 seed under the old ranking criteria.

In the NET, however, Kansas is ranked 18th and is likely headed for a No. 3 or No. 4 seed.

The reason for that divide is margin of victory. Of Kansas' 18 wins, 11 were decided by nine points or fewer, and eight were separated by two possessions. Meanwhile, the Jayhawks had a 17-point loss at Iowa State and a 10-point loss at Texas.

They have more quality wins than anyone and have challenged themselves on a nightly basis, but the NET isn't impressed because they aren't blowing teams out.

But Kansas is going to get into the NCAA tournament regardless. It might not be fair to face a more upset-capable No. 14 seed in the first round instead of a No. 16 seed, but the Jayhawks will get their chance to play for a title.

Others might not be so lucky.

One of those teams is VCU. The Rams are No. 28 in RPI thanks to a solid showing against a nonconference strength of schedule that ranks third toughest nationally. They are 17-6 with nice wins over Texas, Temple and Hofstra and just one less-than-ideal loss to Charleston. One year ago, that type of resume would've been sitting pretty as a No. 9 or No. 10 seed.

But VCU's offensive efficiency is a disaster, ranked 223rd on KenPom. Those quality wins over Texas, Temple and Hofstra came by a combined margin of nine points, so the Rams are ranked 44th in the NET and would probably need to win the Atlantic 10 tournament to go to the Big Dance.

Bruce Kluckhohn/Associated Press/Associated Press

Similarly, Minnesota is 16-8, with seven Quadrant 1 or Quadrant 2 wins and just one ""bad"" loss to Boston College that bounces back and forth between Quadrant 2 and Quadrant 3. That used to be a strong tournament resume, but the Golden Gophers are ranked significantly lower in the NET (No. 58) than they are in RPI (No. 47). That's because one of the five quality wins came by a margin of more than seven points, while five of their six losses were by a double-digit margin.

And while those two teams are in danger of missing the tournament despite solid seasons, the disturbing part is the two undeserving teams that might take their place in the field.

No team has benefited more from the RPI-to-NET switch than North Carolina State.

The Wolfpack played a pathetically weak nonconference schedule, lining up eight home games against teams currently ranked outside the Top 275 on both KenPom and the NET. Combine that with a 1-6 record in Quadrant 1 games, and NC State ranks 112th in RPI.

But because the Wolfpack beat Mount St. Mary's, Maryland Eastern Shore, UNC Asheville, Maine, Saint Peter's, Western Carolina, USC Upstate and Loyola MD by a combined margin of 35.9 points per game, the NET couldn't care less about the weak schedule.

Take out those eight games, and NC State has allowed seven more points than it has scored, but it has an average scoring margin of plus-12.1 and ranks 35th in the NET because of it. That's 77 spots higher than its RPI ranking and inexplicably puts the Wolfpack in great shape for a trip to the NCAA tournament.

Nebraska is in a similar situation.

Ranked 110th in RPI with a 3-10 Big Ten record and little more than a couple of wins over bubble-y opponents, the Cornhuskers would be a complete afterthought in the bracketology conversation right now. However, four of their five best wins came by a margin of at least 15 points, and they opened the season with back-to-back wins over lowly Mississippi Valley State and Southeastern Louisiana by a combined score of 193-72.

Lo and behold, Nebraska is No. 40 in the NET and is right on the tournament bubble.

Nati Harnik/Associated Press/Associated Press

So here's the $64,000 question: Why would anyone want to put together a schedule like Kansas or VCU did when you can blow out terrible opponents for six weeks and look just as good?

That's where this move to the NET could be awful for college basketball as we know it.

Getting to the NCAA tournament is the all-important goal for coaches and athletic directors. Sure, you want to develop your players and make sure they get their degrees, but no one cares about your graduation rate if you never go dancing in March. It stands to reason that you're going to see more and more teams going the NC State route of scheduling one or two quality opponents and loading up the rest of the nonconference schedule with cream puffs.

At least when teams were ""gaming"" the RPI, they were filling up their schedules with borderline top-100 teams that they should be able to beat, which usually produced a lot of watchable games. They also tried to avoid Quadrant 4 games that would hurt their RPI and SOS even if they won by a million. Oklahoma's schedule for this season is a great example of the way things used to be.

But now the NCAA is encouraging teams to run up the score against terrible opponents, because if you beat Delaware State by 61 and lose to Duke by 27, good job, that's still an impressive average scoring margin.

A big reason the NCAA has been so hush hush about the NET's formula is that it is getting tweaked throughout the season in an attempt to find the sweet spot of emphasis/weight for efficiency and scoring margin.

By the time they ""perfect"" the formula and are willing to share it with the public, though, the damage may have already been done. Some coaches are already making endgame decisions based on the margin, and rest assured there are going to be a ton of feather-light nonconference schedules cobbled together for next season.

There are always going to be outliers with any ranking system, but by rating teams like NC State and Nebraska ahead of Minnesota and VCU—and by penalizing Kansas for its aggressive schedule rather than rewarding it—schools around the country are getting the message to take it easy in November and December until further notice.

We'll have to wait until Selection Sunday to see how the selection committee actually handles these extreme resumes. If they treat the NET the same way they treated the RPI and merely use it as a sorting tool before really digging into the teams and their schedules to decide who belongs, they should be able to weed out the frauds and prop up the underrated squads.

But if they still need to massage the data and seem to have just as many aberrations as before—if not more—what was the point?

Read More","Denver (CNN) Fifteen months of simmering frustration boiled over Monday as Denver teachers went on strike.

It's the latest in a long line of teachers' strikes that spread across the country last year and keeps gaining momentum this year

The Denver Classroom Teachers Association and Denver Public Schools made a last-ditch effort to settle their differences over the weekend. But the talks went nowhere, meaning up to 92,000 students will go to school without their teachers indefinitely.

""We're hoping for a quick solution to this whole thing,"" DCTA lead negotiator Rob Gould said Monday. ""We're hoping (school district officials) come to the table tomorrow ready to listen so we can get back to work. Because our teachers want to be in the classrooms with their kids.""

The big sticking point involves teachers' base salaries.

Teachers say they're fed up with uncertain income year to year, since DPS' pay system uses unpredictable bonuses to compensate for low base pay.

""You can't bank anything on what you're going to make each year because they have these little bonuses that come and go,"" said Spanish teacher Kelsey Brown. ""Two years ago, I made more than I'm making now.""

The 31-year-old teacher made $56,000 last year, but the rising cost of living in Denver means she has to work extra jobs -- as a lacrosse coach, exchange program coordinator and summer camp employee.

The union says students deserve teachers who ""stay in Denver for the entirety of their careers, and Denver educators deserve to afford to live in the communities they serve.""

The school district said it's listening to teachers' concerns and made a series of offers to the union -- all of which have been rejected.

""I am extremely disappointed that the DCTA walked away from the table,"" Superintendent Susana Cordova said late Saturday. ""We presented an updated proposal that responds to what we heard from our teachers ... and significantly increases the base pay for all of our educators.""

What both sides have put up

Denver Public Schools says it's offered:

-- $23 million in new funds next year for teachers' base salaries. (That would increase the average teacher's salary from about $55,000 to $61,000 next year.)

-- A total investment of $55 million over the next three years.

-- An increased starting salary of $45,800 for new teachers.

-- Another $2 million investment in base pay for teachers and specialized staff members that would ""come from additional, painful cuts to our central departments, which we estimate to be an elimination of about 150 positions in the central office.""

-- The elimination of performance bonuses for central office senior staff. ""We would invest those funds directly in our highest-needs schools, with a proposed increase in incentive pay for teaching in our schools with the highest poverty rates,"" the school district said. ""Our offer increases that incentive from $2,500 to $3,000.""

DPS illustrated how its concessions to the union -- more than $20 million since last June -- is significantly more than the union's decrease in demands.

But the union said it's still waiting for ""a fair, competitive and transparent salary schedule that prioritizes base salary over complicated, unreliable bonuses.""

""We are incredibly disappointed that on the last day of bargaining and less than two days before a strike, they doubled down on one-time incentives teachers do not want, and the data shows do not work to keep teachers in their schools,"" DCTA President and teacher Henry Roman said.

What students will do without their teachers

It's not clear how many of DPS' 5,000-plus teachers will be absent indefinitely. So far, the school district had received more than 2,000 requests for substitute teachers this week, DPS spokeswoman Anna Alejo said.

The DCTA union, which represents most of Denver's teachers, said 93% of its members voted to authorize a strike. So many students will have no clue when they'll see their teachers again.

Despite the strike, DPS said students should still go to class this week. All schools except preschools will run on normal schedules, as will bus transportation.

""Qualified DPS staff, including certified guest teachers and administrators with educator licenses, will be in schools providing instruction during the strike,"" the school district said.

About 300 substitutes have been hired, and about 1,400 central office staffers have been re-assigned to schools, Alejo said.

Some teachers are too broke to strike

Since teachers aren't getting paid while on strike, not every teacher who wants to strike can do so.

""I really, really want to because I do support the mission ... but I literally financially cannot afford to,"" said math teacher Sophia Leung. ""For me to lose out on $200 of pay a day, it does impact my bills for the month.""

And as a first-year teacher, Leung said she can't even afford the $70 monthly dues to join the local teachers' union.

But this renewed wave of teachers' strikes shows the sacrifices teachers are willing to make, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.

""A strike is not a first resort for anyone. It's a last resort -- especially for teachers who are asked to do more with less every day,"" she said. ""And enough is enough.""","(CNN) A Long Island, New York, school district is investigating reports that a picture of nooses labeled ""back to school necklaces"" was displayed in a middle school classroom.

Arthur Mackey Jr., a pastor at Mount Sinai Baptist Church Cathedral in Roosevelt, said he received the image -- which is part of a larger collage reportedly displayed in a classroom -- from a teacher in the school system. He posted it on Facebook and called on the school district to take action.

""When I heard about it I said that this is outrageous,"" Mackey told CNN. ""The majority of students are minority students, African-American and Hispanic. For the image to be on the wall ... is totally unacceptable.""

In a statement, the Roosevelt School District said it is aware of the ""inappropriate conduct"" and investigating. The school district said it is unable to comment further, calling the incident a ""personnel matter.""

""The Board of Education has zero tolerance for the display of racially offensive images,"" the district's statement said.

1. Border security talks

The chances of another government shutdown shot up over the weekend after talks between Republicans and Democrats on border security broke down. The sticking points in the talks are the level of funding for barriers on the border and how much money to spend on ICE detention facilities. Another partial government shutdown could start at the end of the week if the two sides can't work out a deal. Meanwhile, there will be dueling rallies tonight in the border city of El Paso, Texas. As President Trump holds a rally to drum up support for a wall on the US-Mexico border, ex-congressman and possible 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke will give a speech across the street at about the same time denouncing that idea.

2. Syria

The final battle is on to kick ISIS out of Syria. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces launched an assault to remove ISIS from its last enclave in the country. ISIS -- which once held an area of land in Syria and Iraq about the size of Portugal -- is hanging on to a tiny sliver of territory in a village in the eastern part of the country. US-led coalition airstrikes are pummeling the village, believed to be filled with at least 500 of ISIS' most experienced and battle-hardened fighters.

3. Denver teachers' strike

Teachers picketed before school last month. Now they're ready for Denver's first strike in 25 years.

4. Washington state snowstorm

Travel will be almost impossible in parts of western Washington today as a wicked winter storm continues to wallop the state. Parts of Seattle were hit with more than 10 inches of snow on Saturday. That's more snow in one day than the city usually gets in a single year. As many as 300 cars were stranded on a highway in blizzard conditions after several wrecks, including a semitruck that jackknifed. More snow will fall today, including up to 36 inches in the South Washington Cascades, but things will get better by midweek, when temperatures start to warm up.

The cityscape is lost in a whiteout as Hershel Odle fishes from a pier in Seattle.

5. Grammys

Can Alicia Keys host, well, everything? Keys, the first female host for the Grammys in 14 years, won high praise for bringing coolness and class to music's biggest night, which saw big wins for women and rap. Childish Gambino's ""This Is America"" made history , winning Grammys for song and record of the year. That's the first time a rap song has ever won those two coveted awards.

AND FINALLY

Hump day","(CNN) Dozens of supporters of President Donald Trump's border security efforts formed a human wall Saturday across a small part of the southern border where there is no fencing.

The group gathered near Sunland Park, New Mexico, linking arms and chanting ""build a wall,"" according to CNN affiliate KFOX.

Many held up American flags. Some sported ""Make America Great Again"" hats, and said they were there to show their support for the construction of a wall at the border.

The demonstration came just two days before President Donald Trump's visit to El Paso, Texas for a rally on Monday.

During his State of the Union address last week, the President made an inaccurate connection between El Paso's previously high crime rates and the construction of a border wall.

West central Washington residents will be waking up to 1 to 3 inches of snow Monday morning, with some areas possibly seeing an even thicker blanket, the NWS said. That's after some areas around the Seattle area were covered in more than 10 inches of snow on Saturday, almost giving the city more snow in one day than it usually gets in a year.

A winter storm watch is in effect from Monday morning through Tuesday afternoon in the west central region of Washington that includes Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia, according to the National Weather Service.

Snow is expected to fall on the area throughout the day Monday, before possibly giving way to freezing rain, rain or sleet, the weather service said.

Read More","Police converged on a high school. Teenagers held their hands aloft while they were escorted outside. Distraught parents mourned their dead children and officials condemned the violence and offered their ""thoughts and prayers.""

But that was soon drowned out by survivors and families of the victims of the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Together, they called for changes that would prevent a similar tragedy from happening to anyone else.

They confronted their lawmakers. They rallied others to their cause. And then they took to the streets of Washington, DC, to put on the March For Our Lives, make impassioned pleas for reform and declare, ""Never Again.""

Gun safety advocates saytheir success is perhaps best illustrated by legislation passed in different states across the country last year: 67 new gun laws were enacted by both Republican and Democratic legislators in 26 states and Washington, DC, according to a year-end report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

""2018 was a momentous year in terms of gun safety legislation,"" said Allison Anderman, the group's managing attorney. ""The sheer number of the significant pieces of legislation that were enacted, the fact that very consequential bills were signed by Republican governors, as well as the very few gains made by the gun lobby really combined to make it kind of an earth-shattering year.""

When contacted by CNN, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association touted its own success. By the NRA's count, 203 ""anti-gun"" bills failed or were defeated in 2018, and 7 more were vetoed by governors. The NRA said that 26 pro-gun laws were enacted at the state level in 2018.

Still, the Giffords Law Center says that state legislatures tackled a wide range of gun safety issues last year, from improving background checks to keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. They implemented extreme risk protection orders, banned bump stocks and large-capacity magazines and tightened laws relating to concealed carry.

For years, gun violence prevention advocates worked to lay a foundation for gun control policies by building an infrastructure and introducing bills, even if they were going to fail, Anderman said, and that helped the ""tremendous success"" advocates saw in 2018.

But the impact of the Parkland shooting, its survivors and the families of the victims was certainly a factor.

""They never backed down,"" Anderman said of the Parkland activists. ""And they were incredibly eloquent and motivated and organized. And the March For Our Lives campaign that they created was tremendously effective at amplifying the message and bringing people into the fold.""

Republicans and Democrats compromised

Advocates for gun safety legislation say that one of the clearest indicators that 2018 was a watershed moment was that the bills weren't limited to Democratic legislatures and governors.

Anderman pointed to Republican governors in both Florida and Vermont , who both signed bills implementing gun control measures.

It took less than a month after the Parkland shooting for Florida's Republican legislature to pass SB 7026 and send it to the desk of then-Gov. Rick Scott.

The bill, also known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, covered a wide range of policies. Some of them were championed by gun control advocates, like allowing law enforcement to ask for an ""extreme risk protection order,"" which temporarily prohibits someone from possessing firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others.

But SB 7026 also provided additional funding for armed school resource officers and cleared the way for armed teachers, as long as the local school district and sheriff's department are in agreement.

Parkland very clearly reminded us that we had to do so much more, that what we had done in the past was not enough. Florida Senate President Bill Galvano

Those approaches aren't favored by many gun control advocates and weren't championed by most of the Parkland students. But they were supported by Andrew Pollack , whose daughter Meadow, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was killed.

In the year since her death, he's worked to make school safety a priority in Florida and met with President Donald Trump . Now, he's a member of the Florida Board of Education, where he hopes to make change happen from the inside.

""School safety should be nonpartisan,"" he recently told CNN's Dianne Gallagher. ""It should be a bipartisan issue. We just want the schools safe. So we should all come together, both sides, and say, what is it going to take to harden the schools?""

Florida Senate President Bill Galvano, who sponsored SB 7026, said he believes the comprehensive nature of the bill was instrumental to its passing, and that all issues needed to be taken into account.

""The truth is,"" he said, ""it's about all of it.""

""I thought that if we were truly being intellectually honest and wanting to address the issue comprehensively, all components needed to be a part of it,"" said Galvano, who sponsored the bill.

After past mass shootings, like those at Sandy Hook and the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, lawmakers tried taking less comprehensive steps.

But, Galvano said, ""Parkland very clearly reminded us that we had to do so much more, that what we had done in the past was not enough.

The survivors and the victims' families who got involved very early were key to the bill's success, Galvano said. ""Certainly, it definitely helped,"" he said, adding that the tragedy of Parkland was one that he believes ""echoed throughout the nation.""

""In some way,"" he said, ""I have to believe that the courageous way we addressed the myriad issues within this bill had to encourage others elsewhere.""

Voters were 'inspired' and took control

But it wasn't just state legislators who passed new gun control measures. Voters in Washington state took matters into their own hands and passed Initiative 1639, the only voter initiative aimed at gun safety that appeared on a ballot last November.

""I was inspired by the response of the high school students from Parkland,"" said Paul Kramer, the initiative's citizen sponsor, ""and the way that they responded following that shooting, speaking out. And it seemed to me that people were listening in new ways.""

Kramer became intimately familiar with the consequences of gun violence after his son was shot at a party among high school friends in 2016. He survived, but three others were killed.

Since then, Kramer has been dedicated to advancing gun safety initiatives, and when at least 2 recent bills aimed at curbing the gun violence epidemic failed to get a floor vote in the last two legislative sessions, he was disappointed, particularly after Parkland.

""That was an even bigger disappointment when the legislature failed to take action after Marjory Stoneman Douglas,"" he said.

But that changed when nearly 60% of voters passed I-1639 , under which gun owners could be held criminally liable if someone who's not allowed to access a firearm, like a child or a felon, uses it in a crime -- unless the gun owner was found to keep the gun secured in a safe or lockbox.

Kramer believes many voters were weary of gun violence, and the shooting in Parkland and the subsequent calls for change left an impression on them. He recalled how local teenagers in his hometown of Mukilteo followed the footsteps of Marjory Stoneman Douglas students and put on their own student-led rally against gun violence last spring.

""People were still very much aware of that and that informed their decision when casting their vote on the ballot in November,"" he said. ""The March For Our Lives movement made an impact in Washington state.""

Protesters participate in the March for Our Lives rally on March 24, 2018, in Washington.

There's still work to be done, advocates say

Despite the gains made by the gun safety movement last year, advocates said there are still clear gaps to fill.

Gun lobbying groups did claim some wins last year, Anderman said.

For example, both Idaho and Wyoming enacted ""Stand Your Ground"" laws, which allow the use of deadly force in response to threats without the fear of criminal prosecution. Oklahoma expanded its ""Stand Your Ground"" law to allow deadly force in houses of worship, and Wyoming also repealed the prohibition of guns in houses of worship.

West Virginia passed a law that forces business owners to allow guns in the parking lots of their businesses, and Nebraska passed a new law that allows the withholding of public information related to firearm registration, possession and sales.

But it seems like nothing could diminish the resolve of the Parkland students who stood up and found themselves at the center of the gun control debate.

""I think we moved the needle. Not enough, but we did,"" Jaclyn Corin, one of the founding members of March For Our Lives and a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, told CNN's Dianne Gallagher of the initial rush of activism that came out of the Parkland shooting.

But there's always more room to make change, she said. And so the students who put on the March For Our Lives focused their energy on encouraging young people to vote for candidates whose policies aligned with theirs. They toured the country , meeting and talking with local activists to build a decentralized coalition to tackle gun violence in their communities.

""We are actively creating a grassroots army of young people that are focused not only on Congress, but on their state legislatures, on their city councils and school boards because that's where the real work gets done,"" Corin said.

""And that's where people need to be putting focus on because, sure, things are going to change on a federal level,"" she added, ""but only if you make noise in your communities.""","Talking With Your Doctor About Treatment of Iron-Deficiency Anemia By Chris Illiades Was this helpful? ( 54 )

If you have iron-deficiency anemia, it means your red blood cells are not carrying enough oxygen. Iron deficiency can cause this problem, because you need iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen in your blood.

Treatment depends on what is causing your iron deficiency. This is the first of several important conversations with your doctor about your anemia. Ask your doctor if your iron deficiency could be from blood loss, not getting enough iron, or an increased demand for iron by your body. Your doctor will look for common causes of iron deficiency and treat these, while also working to restore iron to your system.

What to Know About Iron Replacement

Ask your doctor if the cause of your iron deficiency can be treated. For example, if blood loss is the cause, your doctor will treat the source of bleeding. You may have a digestive problem that keeps you from absorbing iron. If you are pregnant, ask your doctor if you may need more iron than you can get from your diet.

Regardless of the cause, once you are diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia, diet and over-the-counter vitamins may not be enough to get your iron levels back to a safe level. Talk to your doctor about iron replacement pills. The average dosage of iron necessary to correct iron deficiency in an adult is between 150 to 200 milligrams (mg) per day.

Your doctor will start you on iron replacement and check your blood levels in about a month. You may need to take iron replacement for another three months to build up an iron reserve supply in your liver. If you can’t get enough iron from pills, your doctor may give you iron intravenously. In very severe cases of iron-deficiency anemia, you may need a blood transfusion.

The Side Effects of Iron Pills

Iron pills can be tough on your digestive system. One reason that some people need to get intravenous iron is that they just can’t tolerate the pills. Side effects of iron pills include nausea, belly pain, diarrhea and constipation. Talk to your doctor about how to reduce these side effects. Suggestions may include:

Taking your iron pills with food

Starting slowly and building up your dosage over several days

Avoiding iron pills at bedtime

Adding fiber to your diet (this causes iron to be absorbed more slowly)

Switching to a different type of iron pill (different pills have different forms of iron)

If you take antacids, your doctor may suggest taking iron pills either two hours before or four hours after your antacid medication. This is because antacids and acid-lowering medications can block your absorption of iron. You doctor may also suggest taking a vitamin C supplement. Vitamin C increases iron absorption.



Talk to Your Doctor About Getting More Iron from Your Diet

Iron from food alone may not be enough to reverse iron-deficiency anemia, but it helps. Increasing dietary iron may also help prevent future anemia. Your doctor may suggest adding:

Red meats, especially liver

Poultry, especially livers and dark meat

Fish, especially shellfish, anchovies or sardines

Leafy green vegetables, especially broccoli, kale and collard greens

Peas and beans

Iron-enriched foods, like some cereals, pastas, rice and breads. Check the label to find out if the food is enriched.","Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax told the Washington Post that he won't resign and is focused on ""getting the truth out.""

Guzmán, 61, faces 10 counts, including engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder the proceeds from narcotics, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other drugs, and use of firearms. He has pleaded not guilty and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.

Jurors, who are partially sequestered, deliberated for four days last week. The twelve jurors -- eight women and four men -- are escorted to and from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn by US marshals. A sworn court officer guards the door of the room where they work, and lunch gets delivered.

Legal experts said the drawn-out deliberations may just reflect the complicated nature of the federal case, which included about 200 hours of testimony since mid-November, boxes upon boxes of physical evidence and 60 pages of jury instructions.

Read More","(CNN) It's now days before another government shutdown -- and this is the day bipartisan negotiators were supposed to announce a deal to avert just that.

Instead, there are no clear answers as to how, or if, another can be avoided.

Bottom line: There is no agreement on the path forward on the conference committee. There is no agreement on what, if any, alternatives could pass both chambers and be signed by the President if the conference committee fails. Monday is a crucial day as lawmakers try and figure a way out of another mess, all as the clock ticks away. At this point, each day leading into the February 15 deadline is enormously consequential.

What to watch

Timeline

In order to get something done by the Friday deadline, House Democrats will likely have to post something Monday or Tuesday (reminder: the chamber has a 72-hour rule). As is always the case, Congress can move quite quickly when it wants to, but at this point there's zero agreement about a backstop or alternative plan between the two parties and chambers. Conference negotiators basically have until the end of Monday to figure something out, aides in both parties say. Then it's on to finding a Plan B (or C or D, etc., etc.).

Some context

As has been noted here for much of the last week, these talks are more complicated than just whether and what kind of border wall barrier could be agreed upon by both sides. There are significant splits, particularly given the Trump administration's immigration enforcement posture, on how the Department of Homeland Security and its components, namely Immigrations Customs Enforcement do their work. An under-appreciated issue, at least in the broader ""border wall"" conversation, has been just how central detention beds for detained undocumented immigrants sits as an issue -- and an extremely divisive one at that -- for both parties.

So this is what happened: Current government funding levels allow for just north of 40,000 detention beds (40,520, to be exact). The Trump administration has already surpassed the number, which it views as the floor, not the ceiling, and largely front-loaded the spending on beds (and reprogramming of funds from other agencies) to fund detention beds throughout this year.

To put a finer point on things: Democrats view detention beds as central to a Trump administration immigration policy that is harsh and needlessly aggressive. Republicans view the detention beds as central to limiting the ability of detained undocumented immigrants from being released into the US as they await hearings.

Democrats entered the negotiations pushing to reduce the number of detention beds funded in the measure to 35,520. The White House and Republicans sought an increase to 52,000.

What blew things up over the weekend was an additional Democratic demand, which came Friday, that a cap be put in place on detention beds used for interior enforcement, or in other words, a cap on the number of beds that could used to detain undocumented immigrants inside the US and not at the southern border. Democrats proposed capping the number of beds at 16,500. That the cap, which would be a new policy restriction, would be proposed in the talks at such a late stage was considered a non-starter by Republicans on the panel.

The Democratic rationale: From Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat on the conference committee and one of the lead House negotiators: ""A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country.""

How this all ties together: The cap on detention beds is seen by Democrats as part of any deal to increase funding border barriers, multiple aides involved with the process say -- an issue where both sides had actually been making some meaningful progress in the days prior to the breakdown.

But as a Democratic aide briefed on the topic told CNN's Manu Raju on Sunday:

""We had been making progress on both border barriers and ICE beds, but Dems cannot agree to physical barrier spending above the current level we want without GOP concessions on ICE,"" the aide said.

What's next

There is truth to the theory, pitched by the few (only) people involved in the talks who choose to find some semblance of optimism in the current breakdown: in negotiations with stakes this high, there often has to be a dramatic breakdown before a deal can come together. Add to that the reality that nobody CNN has spoken to in either party has any appetite for a second government shutdown, and perhaps the will to get something done, which was so pervasive late last week, will come back to the forefront.

The problem with that theory in this case was just how explosive and public the breakdown was between the two parties Sunday. For more than a week, only snippets, if even that, of the proposals traded between the two sides leaked out. Talks remained very close to the vest. That changed entirely on Sunday, when both sides moved quickly to get out the details of their proposals -- and why the other side was responsible for the breakdown in talks.

One person involved said cooler heads were starting to prevail later Sunday afternoon as lawmakers attempted to reconnect and restart the talks, but the weekend represented a significant break between the two sides.

The backup plans

House Democrats, according to two people involved, are considering moving forward on the package on the six non-Department of Homeland Security appropriations measures, at full-year levels, plus a continuing resolution for DHS. The expectation is the CR for DHS won't be clean however, and will include restrictions on detention beds and language to prevent reprogramming of funds for a border wall.

In other words, it's non-starter for the White House and, likely, Senate Republicans.

Senate Republicans are also working through options as well, but it's unclear at the moment what they're willing to move forward on, aides said, as they wait to see first what House Democrats go with.

The President

All eyes on Capitol Hill will soon be on Trump's rally in El Paso. Multiple GOP aides have become more certain in recent days that Trump will pull the trigger on executive action and an emergency declaration to fund the border wall himself, regardless of what Congress does. But will that help clear the way for Congress to keep the government open?

Mulvaney's view: Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, said this on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, which was pinging around aides in both parties on Sunday:

""You asked me a question: is the shutdown entirely off the table? I would say no.""

Context from the weekend: The tentative plan going into this past weekend, according to some people involved in the border security negotiations, was to have conferees sign the agreement on Monday morning. Instead, conferees are struggling to get one another on the phone to try and salvage something -- and leadership in both chambers is now actively looking toward backup plans to fund the government.

""Life comes at you fast whenever you start feel positive about immigration talks in this place,"" one Republican aide, who has worked on immigration issues for years, told CNN on Sunday.","(CNN) Freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota is facing backlash after suggesting Republican support of Israel is fueled by donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a prominent pro-Israel group.

Omar responded to a tweet by journalist Glenn Greenwald that reads, ""GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy threatens punishment for @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib over their criticisms of Israel. It's stunning how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation even if it means attacking free speech rights of Americans.""

Omar replied, ""It's all about the Benjamins baby,"" followed by a musical notes emoji. Omar has been critical of the Israeli government over its treatment of Palestinians and supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a non-violent activist campaign that aims to put economic and political pressure on Israel over its actions toward Palestinians, including calling for an end to Israeli occupation of the West Bank.

In response to Omar's tweet Sunday, a woman named Batya Ungar-Sargon, an opinion editor of the Forward, tweeted, ""Would love to know who @IlhanMN thinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel, though I think I can guess. Bad form, Congresswoman. That's the second anti-Semitic trope you've tweeted.""

Omar responded to the tweet and wrote, ""AIPAC!""

The freshman congresswoman faced swift backlash from both Democrats and Republicans on Twitter.

New York Democratic Rep. Max Rose tweeted , ""When someone uses hateful and offensive tropes and words against people of any faith, I will not be silent. Congresswoman Omar's statements are deeply hurtful to Jews, including myself. Implying that Americans support Israel because of money alone is offensive enough. But to go a step further, and retweet someone declaring their pain at her sentiment is simply unacceptable.""

""At a time when anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise, our leaders should not be invoking hurtful stereotypes and caricatures of Jewish people to dismiss those who support Israel,"" Rose tweeted.

""In the Democratic Party - and in the United States of America - we celebrate the diversity of our people, and the Gods we pray to, as a strength,"" Rose continued. ""The Congresswoman's statements do not live up to that cherished ideal.""

CNN has also reached out to Omar's office for comment on her tweets.

On Friday, before the tweets were posted, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy railed against recent comments by Omar and other freshman Democrats who have spoken critically against the Israeli government over its treatment of Palestinians. He said if Democratic leaders don't take action, he may act on his own.

McCarthy directly compared their comments, which Republicans have labeled anti-Semitic, to the recent comments by Rep. Steve King of Iowa when he told The New York Times, ""White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"" McCarthy pointed to actions that he took to punish King, such as blocking him from committee assignments, and criticized Democratic leaders for being silent about their own members.

It is unclear what actions he can take, though there is already a resolution in the works that introduced by New York Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin that calls for a rejection of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred in the US and around the world. The text of the resolution mentions Omar by name, citing, among other things, Omar's statement that ""Israel has hypnotized the world.""

CNN has reached out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office for comment on Omar's remarks and if they will take action against her.

Two Jewish Democratic House Members -- Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Elaine Luria of Virginia -- have begun gathering signatures for a letter to send to House Democratic leaders saying they must confront ""hateful tropes"" and ""stereotypes"" against Jews, emanating from comments and positions taken by members of their caucus.

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat, issued a statement Monday saying Omar had invoked ""the anti-Semitic trope of 'Jewish money.'"" Omar is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

""I fully expect that when we disagree on the Foreign Affairs Committee, we will debate policy on the merits and never question members' motives or resort to personal attacks,"" said Engel, who is Jewish, in his statement. ""Criticism of American policy toward any country is fair game, but this must be done on policy grounds.""

Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" that while he had not seen Omar's comments previously and he would not agree with Omar's comments, he wouldn't ""take it as anti-Semitism"" and that he doesn't ""believe she would harbor those sorts of views as they've been characterized.""

""I would say that she probably objects to the fact that when it comes to issues around foreign policy or comes to issues, specifically to Israel, there are a lot of interests, a lot of folks who make campaign contributions based on a person's position on israel,"" Kildee said. ""I think we ought to be careful not to construe that in anything other than a concern about the fact that money has undue influence on political decision making.""

Rep. Jim Himes too defended Omar saying, ""this is really a good example of the need for all of us to be very, very specific about what it is we are saying so that we don't come off as being anti-Semitic, as being racist, as being bigoted.""

""If you have concerns about the state of Israel, make sure, especially given the nature of the history of Israel, the nature of anti-Semitism -- It's perfectly legitimate to criticize Israel or to criticize the pro-Israeli lobby,"" the Connecticut Democrat said. ""Just please be careful to do it in a way that can't be interpreted as being anti-Semitic.""

Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley responded to Omar's ""AIPAC"" tweet and wrote on Twitter , ""To see this at the UN was a fight every day. This CANNOT be tolerated in our own Congress by anyone of either party. In a time of increased anti semitism, we all must be held to account. No excuses."" She added a heart and flag emoji followed by, ""#NoSpaceForHate #NoToleranceForAntiSemitism #WhatIsHappeningWithPeople""

Chelsea Clinton also weighed in on Twitter, writing, ""We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism.""

Co-signed as an American. We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 11, 2019

Last week, Omar defended her views on Israel and told CNN it is ""not surprising"" she is generating attention and said, ""I think it is actually exciting because we are finally able to have conversations that we weren't really willing to.""

""It is really important for us to get a different lens about what peace in that region could look like and the kind of difficult conversations we need to have about allies,"" Omar told CNN on Tuesday.

This story has been updated with additional developments Mondays.","Washington (CNN) Embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said that since becoming engulfed in controversy surrounding his use of blackface decades ago, he has learned that he ""was born in white privilege"" and ""why the use of blackface is so offensive.""

In an interview that aired Monday on ""CBS This Morning,"" Northam also referred to enslaved Africans as ""indentured servants from Africa"" before acknowledging that such a practice was slavery.

In Northam's first TV interview since the controversy erupted 10 days ago, CBS' Gayle King asks him what he has learned since dealing with the fallout from the revelation that his 1984 medical school yearbook page contained a racist photo and his own admission that he once dressed in blackface on a separate occasion.

""Well, several things, starting with I was born in white privilege and that has implications to it and it is much different the way a white person such as myself is treated in this country ..."" he said in the interview.

""Did you not know that you were born into white privilege?"" King asks, cutting off the governor.

Read More","(CNN) America could be sliding toward a new government shutdown and President Donald Trump may face a fateful choice over his border wall as another knife-edge week opens in Washington.

Democratic and Republican negotiators last week seemed to be on course for a deal to fund the government and boost border security short of paying for a wall, and it seemed possible that Trump might grudgingly sign on.

But the talks ground to a halt over the weekend in a dispute over limits demanded by Democrats on the number of places available in detention centers used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations away from border areas.

The disagreement appeared to dash hopes that a deal could be reached by Monday to allow each chamber of Congress plenty of time to pass legislation well before a Friday deadline.

""I think the talks are stalled right now,"" said Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the 17-member conference committee on ""Fox News Sunday.""

If no deal is reached and no stop-gap spending measure emerges, a new government shutdown could be triggered, again subjecting 800,000 federal workers who could be furloughed or asked to work without pay.

The most recent shutdown, which was the longest in history, ended last month in victory for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who refused to fund the wall — and with a damaging political defeat for the President in their first significant clash since the midterm elections.

The unpredictable Trump could rattle the effort to avoid a second shutdown when he heads to El Paso, Texas, on Monday for his first political rally of the year -- a context which seems unlikely to see him offer flexibility on the notion of building a wall.

Sudden pessimism over the conference talks between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate reflected the uncertainty and raw political nerves on Capitol Hill at the dawn of a new era of divided government.

It also reflected the excruciatingly tough task of seeking compromise on immigration policy, an issue with visceral power for both parties and which is almost an existential issue for the presidency of Trump.

Even if it turns out that the weekend's hiccup is just a typical Capitol Hill delay en route to a deal, it could precipitate even more uncertainty, since the compromise is certain to fall short of $5.7 billion in money Trump has demanded for his wall.

In that scenario, Trump would again face a choice between climbing down on the central issue of his 2016 campaign and alienating grassroots supporters and conservative pundits or refusing to sign a bill passed by Congress.

If he digs in, the President could spark a new partial shutdown for which he would again risk being blamed.

Trump's dilemma

Last week, Shelby had fueled optimism for an agreement after visiting Trump to update him on the process.

But on Sunday, he was more downbeat when asked if hopes of an agreement on Monday were realistic.

""I'm not confident we're going to get there,"" he said on Fox.

Two senior Republican aides told CNN that the cap demanded by Democrats on internal enforcement beds would force ICE officials to make impossible decisions about which immigrants to detain.

A House Democratic aide told CNN that Republican claims that the proposal would allow ""violent criminals to be released"" was false.

""This cap will force the Trump administration to prioritize arresting and deporting serious criminals, not law-abiding immigrants,"" the statement said.

Shelby also indicated that there was no agreement yet on how much money Democrats will allow to be spent for barriers on the US-Mexico border.

House Democratic Majority leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said on CNN on Saturday that he would be prepared to live with a deal that offered up to $2 billion for a border barrier.

But the mix of border barriers, fencing and repairing barriers that Democrats seem prepared to support falls well short of the 200-mile wall or steel fence that Trump has recently been touting to his own supporters.

The question will be if he could somehow claim that even such a partial solution fulfills his promise to build a border wall.

Such uncertainty is why it is unclear whether Trump would sign on to a deal that emerges from the Capitol Hill talks, especially since he has balked about a solution that could get him into hot water on his right flank before.

It's also why a shutdown, once seen as highly unlikely given the political damage it wrought upon the White House last time around, cannot be ruled out.

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appears to have little more insight into what might happen this week than anyone else.

""You asked me a question: is the shutdown entirely off the table? I would say no,"" Mulvaney said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

So it's quite possible that Trump could find himself in exactly the same, vulnerable political position that he did during the previous shutdown.

Does he refuse to budge on funding for his wall — that represents an almost mythical symbol of his appeal to his most loyal supporters — and initiate a shutdown that would likely be opposed by a majority of Americans?

Or does he keep faith with his base and risk the ire of many other voters who are furious at government dysfunction and have told pollsters they oppose a shutdown brought on by the President to get his wall?

Trying to shift the blame

Trump seemed to be looking for a way out of his box on Sunday by trying to position Democrats to take the blame for any new shutdown.

""I don't think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!"" Trump tweeted.

""Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

I don't think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2019

It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2019

The weekend's developments still leave Trump in a delicate spot.

There's little appetite among many Capitol Hill Republicans for a repeat of the 35-day shutdown that started before Christmas and stretched into the new era of Democratic control of the House of Representatives.

There is also discomfort among some Senate Republicans over Trump's alternative plan — a declaration of national emergency that could allow the President to reprogram financing from other projects in the Pentagon.

Such a move would open the possibility that a future Democratic President could use the precedent to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress to exert executive power on another issue — combating global warming for instance.

And even if Trump does declare a national emergency, he would likely face an immediate court challenge and the most consequential constitutional showdown in an administration that has frequently tested presidential norms.

The sudden stalling of the conference committee talks at the weekend led some Democrats to consider a backstop plan.

Two sources involved in the talks said that if the impasse drags on, House Democrats may move a package that would fund the Department of Homeland Security through September along with some other departments.

That path would provoke another dilemma since it would presumably force Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to consider whether to take up a bill that the President might be unlikely to sign if it lacked wall funding.

In the last shutdown, McConnell, seeking to avoid a damaging public split in the GOP caucus, declined to expose his senators to votes on any measure that was not agreed to in advance by Democrats and Republicans.

Nothing is clear. No key player in the drama can be sure what their opponent will do next. The stakes are rising and the clock is ticking down into yet another crucial deadline on Friday.","(CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Monday launching the American Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiative, a senior administration official told reporters in a background call over the weekend.

The initiative outlines ""bold, decisive actions to ensure that AI continues to be fueled by American ingenuity, reflects American values and is applied for the benefit of the American people,"" the official said.

Aimed at bolstering American leadership in AI, the initiative features a ""multi-pronged approach"" that is categorized into five key pillars: research and development, AI infrastructure, AI governance, workforce and international engagement.

When asked about the benefit of AI to the American public, the official emphasized how ""artificial intelligence is something that touches every aspect of people's lives,"" pointing to medical care, food production and energy resource extraction as examples. The official also sought to allay concerns that investments in new AI technology may displace American workers, noting that the administration is ""very cognizant of"" the issue and has already developed programming like apprenticeships and career special education programs to address it.

As part of his State of the Union address last week, Trump called for ""investments in the cutting edge industries of the future,"" and the administration official underscored the importance of AI in ""driving"" these future industries for the US.

Read More","(CNN) As special counsel Robert Mueller prepares a final report on his investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump campaign complicity, two historic presidential inquiries offer distinct -- and clashing -- models.

In 1974, when special prosecutor Leon Jaworski delivered a report related to President Richard Nixon's cover-up of the Watergate burglary, it was a tightly written 55-page catalogue of evidence. It contained no moral judgments and made clear that action against the President rested with Congress.

In 1998, after independent counsel Ken Starr finished a investigation of President Bill Clinton, his report was more than 400 pages , including a salacious narrative of the President's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. It contained 11 possible grounds for impeachment, beginning with the assertion that Clinton lied under oath.

The key Jaworski document delivered to the House of Representatives was kept under seal for more than four decades, released only last October. The Starr report became public immediately, distributed on the Internet and shocking the public with its voluminous details about Clinton's dalliances with Lewinsky.

Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. Clinton was impeached but acquitted by the Senate.

Today, as Mueller reportedly nears the end of the Russia probe tracing to 2016, these two historic episodes suggest possible approaches for a final report but also point to differences for the current multi-year probe hanging over the Trump presidency.

Unlike with the work of Jaworski and Starr, Mueller is operating under a statute that requires he submit a confidential report directly to the attorney general, who has discretion on how to handle it. William Barr, likely to be confirmed as attorney general shortly, has not pledged to make the full report public. And it is unclear what information will be transmitted to Congress.

Justice Department guidelines say a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted; it would be up to the House to act on possible allegations of obstruction of justice or other wrongdoing. If it were to impeach the President, a trial would be held in the Senate.

Jaworski's 'road map'

The Nixon and Clinton investigations differed significantly from the outset. The former began with the June 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office building.

At the time that Jaworski delivered his March 1974 report, he had already brought multiple criminal cases against officials who conspired in the burglary and its cover-up. His office had obtained several guilty pleas and indictments were pending against Nixon officials in the highest echelons, including former Attorney General John Mitchell. Jaworski was about to seek a subpoena for Nixon's Oval Office tapes, and the House Judiciary Committee had already begun the impeachment process.

The Jaworski ""road map,"" as it became known, helped steer the Democratic-led House as it prepared articles of impeachment, spurring Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974.

In Jaworski's resignation letter to then-Attorney General William Saxbe in October 1974, he briefly observed, ""While the grand jury report, which presented the chain of evidence in detail, has not been published, I am informed that it served as a major guide for the staff and members of the Committee in the development of ... the Articles of Impeachment.""

That report was made public last October, through a lawsuit brought by Protect Democracy, on behalf of Harvard Law Professor Jack Goldsmith, LawFare editor in chief Benjamin Wittes, and Stephen Bates, currently a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who in the 1990s was part of the Starr legal team.

In a LawFare piece last October , Goldsmith and Wittes praised the Jaworski document for its brevity and neutral, non-prosecutorial tone.

""It does not argue that Nixon committed any impeachable offense,"" they wrote. ""It simply makes a series of factual claims, each written in a spare and clinical fashion, each supported by citations to material the special prosecutor's office provided to Congress.""

Goldsmith and Wittes said that for Mueller one lesson would be: Less is more.

""The document is powerful because it is so spare; because it is trying to inform, not to persuade; because it utterly lacks rhetorical excess,"" they wrote. ""Starr took a different path.""

The Starr report

The Starr report, which was also prepared by now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was intensely prosecutorial and spared little in terms of sexual descriptions of the Clinton and Lewinsky liaisons.

Bates, who defends the Starr report, agrees however with Goldsmith and Wittes about the value of a special counsel stressing the role of Congress in deciding a president's fate. In an interview on Saturday he also emphasized the differences at the Capitol during the Nixon and Clinton episodes.

Unlike in 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee was already pursing Watergate, he said the House in 1998 was essentially waiting for the Starr report.

""Whatever the Starr office was going to send to the Hill, it was going to be more detailed than the Jaworski report,"" Bates said.

Once the Starr report was in hand, House Republicans initiated impeachment proceedings. Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted Clinton and he served out his full second term as president.

Of Mueller, Bates predicted a fuller analysis than Jaworski's, simply because the Russia investigation appears far more complicated.

Added Bates, ""The world is just waiting for Mueller now.""","Washington (CNN) Former first lady Michelle Obama made a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night and talked about how music has ""always helped me tell my story.""

Obama appeared on stage alongside Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jennifer Lopez, and host Alicia Keys.

""From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side —"" Obama began, but was immediately drowned out by thunderous applause from the crowd.

After sustained applause, Obama laughed and said, ""All right you all, all right, we got a show to do.""

""From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side, to the 'who run the world' songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story. And I know that's true for everybody here,"" Obama said.
